# TheAlgabhetBot
A bot which can search using specific Keywords that helps the user find what they require almost immediately.
Our bot initially had certain hurdles hence why we used the HTTP request API for the integration between the backend and front end.
As of now the page can only retireve information related to 'Artificial Intelligence' as we had used the wikipedia API which and the topic 'AI' had been given for retrival.
We had already retirved around 2000 AI related articles under the folder #AI_Articles and the user input is checked there of how relevent the information is.

For future implementation:
A response button has been added to the front end, the purpose of this is so that whne a particular information is retrived ,if the user found the information relevent and clicks on 'Yes' information is relevant. Then tbe program would push the relevance upwards so it gets more displayed next time onwards

Multiple responses since we dont want the user to just be handed one particular document but rather 3-4 documents where the user can select the best psosible outcome. This also trains the bot to understand what Document is more relevant.
