Machine learning methods for the analysis of neuroimaging data are used to help diagnose stroke. Historically multiple approaches to this problem involved neural networks.

Multiple approaches to detect strokes used machine learning. As proposed by Mirtskhulava, feed-forward networks were tested to detect strokes using neural imaging. As proposed by Titano 3D-CNN techniques were tested in supervised classification to screen head CT images for acute neurologic events. Three-dimensional Convolutional neural network|CNN and Support-vector machine|SVM methods are often used. Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as natural language processing to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database. Text Nailing, an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017.

This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets, as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals.
