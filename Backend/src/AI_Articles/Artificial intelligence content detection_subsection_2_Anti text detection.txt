There is software available designed to bypass AI text detection. 

In August 2023, a study was conducted by Taloni, et al. at Magna Gr√¶cia University and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, to test AI text detection. The study tested an AI detection tool called Originality.ai, and found it detected GPT-4 with a mean accuracy of 91.3%.

However, when the tool was reprocessed the tool through another software called Undetectable.ai, the detection accuracy of Originality.ai dropped to a mean accuracy of 27.8%.

Some experts also believe that techniques like digital watermarking are ineffective because they can be removed or added to trigger false positives.
