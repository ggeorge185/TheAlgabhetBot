Aristotle identified analogy in works such as Metaphysics and Nicomachean Ethics
* Rome|Roman lawyers used analogical reasoning and the Greek word ''analogia''. 
* In Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic, analogical reasoning was used for the process of qiyas in Islamic sharia law and fiqh jurisprudence. 
* Medieval lawyers distinguished ''analogia legis'' and ''analogia iuris'' (see below). 
* The Middle Ages saw an increased use and theorization of analogy.  
* In Christianity|Christian scholasticism|scholastic theology, analogical arguments were accepted in order to explain the attributes of God. 
** Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas made a distinction between ''equivocal'', ''univocal'' and ''analogical'' terms, the last being those like ''healthy'' that have different but related meanings. Not only a person can be "healthy", but also the food that is good for health (see the contemporary distinction between polysemy and homonymy). 
** Thomas Cajetan wrote an influential treatise on analogy. In all of these cases, the wide Platonic and Aristotelian notion of analogy was preserved. 

Cajetan named several kinds of analogy that had been used but previously unnamed, particularly: 

* Analogy of attribution (''analogia attributionis'') or improper proportionality, e.g., "This food is healthy."
* Analogy of proportionality (''analogia proportionalitatis'') or proper proportionality, e.g., "2 is to 1 as 4 is to 2", or "the goodness of humans is relative to their essence as the goodness of God is relative to God's essence."
* Metaphor, e.g., steely determination.
