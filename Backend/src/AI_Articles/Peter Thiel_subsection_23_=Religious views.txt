Thiel is a self-described Christianity|Christian and a promoter of René Girard's Christian anthropology. He grew up in an Evangelicalism|evangelical household but, as of 2011, describes his religious beliefs as "somewhat heterodox", and stated: "I believe Christianity is true but I don't sort of feel a compelling need to convince other people of that."

During his time at Stanford University, Thiel attended a lecture given by René Girard. Girard, a Catholic Church|Catholic, explained the role of sacrifice and the scapegoat mechanism in resolving social conflict, which appealed to Thiel as it offered a basis for his Christian faith without the Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalism of his parents.
