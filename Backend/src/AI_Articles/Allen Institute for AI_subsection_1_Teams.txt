Aristo''': Aristo is a flagship project of AI2 that was inspired by a similar project called Project Halo carried out by Seattle-based investment company Vulcan. The original project goal was to design an artificially intelligent system that could successfully read, learn, and reason from texts and ultimately demonstrate its knowledge by successfully passing an 8th-grade science exam â€“ the team achieved this objective in 2018. The current focus of the team is to build the next generation of systems that can systematically reason, explain, and continually improve over time.
*'''PRIOR''': The PRIOR team seeks to advance the field of computer vision by creating AI systems that can see, explore, learn, and reason about the world. The team released the open embodied AI platform AI2-THOR in 2016, supporting the training of AI agents in simulated environments. In February 2018, the team released the game Iconary as a demonstration of an AI that can understand and produce situated scenes from a limited set of icons.
*'''Semantic Scholar''': Semantic Scholar tool is an Artificial intelligence|artificial-intelligence backed search engine for academic publications publicly released in November 2015. It uses advances in natural language processing to provide features such as summaries for scholarly papers, contextual information about inline citations, and the ability to create libraries of papers and receive paper recommendations.
*'''AllenNLP''': The AllenNLP team works on research to improve NLP systems' performance and accountability, and advance scientific methodologies for evaluating and understanding NLP systems. The team produces its own research as well as open-source tools to accelerate NLP research.
*'''MOSAIC''': The Mosaic project is focused on defining and building Commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)|common sense knowledge and reasoning for AI systems.
*'''AI for the Environment''': These teams seek to apply artificial intelligence solutions to the prevention of poaching and illegal fishing in locations around the world, as well as environmental problems like climate modeling and wildfire management. The teams in this group include EarthRanger, Skylight, Climate Modeling, and Wildlands.
