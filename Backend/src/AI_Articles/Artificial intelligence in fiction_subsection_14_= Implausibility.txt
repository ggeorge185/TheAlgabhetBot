Engineers and scientists have taken an interest in the way AI is presented in fiction. In films like the 2014 ''Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina'' or 2015 ''Chappie (film)|Chappie'', a single isolated genius becomes the first to successfully build an artificial general intelligence; scientists in the real world deem this to be unlikely. In ''Chappie'', ''Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence'', and ''Tron'', human minds are capable of being uploaded into artificial or virtual bodies; usually no reasonable explanation is offered as to how this difficult task can be achieved. In the ''I, Robot'' and ''Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man'' films, robots that are programmed to serve humans spontaneously generate new goals on their own, without a plausible explanation of how this took place. Analysing Ian McDonald's 2004 ''River of Gods'', Krzysztof Solarewicz identifies the ways that it depicts AIs, including "independence and unexpectedness, political awkwardness, openness to the alien and the occidental value of authenticity."
