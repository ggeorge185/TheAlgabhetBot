One of the oldest contests known is the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) which originated in the 1970s and has grown to include 88 countries in its 2011 edition.

From 1990 to 1994, Owen Astrachan, Vivek Khera and David Kotz ran one of the first distributed, internet-based programming contests inspired by the ICPC.

Interest in competitive programming has grown extensively since 2000 to tens of thousands of participants (see #Notable competitions|Notable competitions), and is strongly connected to the growth of the Internet, which facilitates holding international contests online, eliminating geographical problems.
