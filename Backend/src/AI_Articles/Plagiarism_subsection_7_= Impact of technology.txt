Expanding accessibility and usage of the internet has a positive correlation with plagiarism. However, a Croatian study found that students were not more likely to plagiarize when using an electronic-writing medium. Educational institutions often emphasize the importance of originality, proper citation, and academic integrity to combat plagiarism. They implement policies, educational programs, and tools like plagiarism detection software to discourage and detect instances of plagiarism.
