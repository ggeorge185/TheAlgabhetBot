Video content analysis is a subset of computer vision and thereby of artificial intelligence. Two major academic benchmark initiatives are TRECVID, which uses a small portion of i-LIDS video footage, and the PETS Benchmark Data. They focus on functionalities such as tracking, left luggage detection and virtual fencing. Benchmark video datasets such as the [http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php UCF101] enables Activity recognition|action recognition researches incorporating Visual temporal attention|temporal and Visual spatial attention|spatial Attention|visual attention with convolutional neural network and long short-term memory. Video analysis software is also being paired with footage from Body worn video|body-worn and Dashcam|dashboard cameras in order to more easily redact footage for public disclosure and to identify events and people in videos.

The EU is funding a Seventh Framework Programme#Framework Programme 7|FP7 project called P-REACT to integrate video content analytics on embedded systems with police and transport security databases.
