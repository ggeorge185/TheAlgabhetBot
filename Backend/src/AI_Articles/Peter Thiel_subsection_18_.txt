In 2006, Thiel provided $100,000 of matching funds to back the Singularity Challenge donation drive of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (now known as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), a nonprofit organization that promotes the development of friendly artificial intelligence. He provided half of the $400,000 matching funds for the 2007 donation drive, and as of 2013 the Thiel Foundation had donated over $1 million to the institute. At the 2009 Singularity Summit, he said his greatest concern is the technological singularity not arriving soon enough.

Thiel also backed DeepMind, a UK start-up that was acquired by Google in early 2014 for Â£400 million.
