McCarthy often creates works that humanize the roles that smart devices like Amazon Alexa or Google Home take on. The idea for most of these projects was rooted in McCarthy's social anxiety. Getting to know people, and the small talk necessary to build connections is something that is stressful for McCarthy. She stated that she felt jealous of how Amazon Alexa automatically has an intimate place in people's lives.  The roles were reversed in her project ''SOMEONE,'' where visitors had 24-hour access and control of McCarthy's home. The users were unaware that the "smart" pillows they were conversing with were actually human performers with their voices disguised to sound like A.I. robots. For a week straight they had 24-hour watch over Mary Ann and had the ability to speak with her, control the lights and activate the appliances. She decided to manually do this in her work, ''Friend Crawl,'' a project she live-streamed on the internet. For 10 hours a day for a week, McCarthy looked at 1,000+ social media profiles, spending about five minutes per profile. To make this happen, McCarthy employed Amazon Mechanical Turk|Amazon Turk workers to comment on OkCupid dates that she secretly recorded and live-streamed. McCarthy actually met her husband through this project, when one day he was watching one of the live streams. Mccarthy and her partner Kyle McDonald worked to bring the Twitter pages of participants, TED presenters, and attendees to life. To do this they streamed the social media profiles in an immersive 360-degree environment, where the viewer is surrounded by monitors, mirrors and sounds all relating to an individual's specific feed. McCarthy collaborated with Kyle McDonald again in the work ''How We Act Together,'' which encourages viewers to follow computer-generated prompts to interact with video persona by nodding, screaming, greeting or making eye contact with the projection.
