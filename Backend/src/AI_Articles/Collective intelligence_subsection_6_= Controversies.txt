Other scholars explain team performance by aggregating team members' general intelligence to the team level instead of building an own overall collective intelligence measure. Devine and Philips (2001) showed in a meta-analysis that mean cognitive ability predicts team performance in laboratory settings (0.37) as well as field settings (0.14) â€“ note that this is only a small effect. Suggesting a strong dependence on the relevant tasks, other scholars showed that tasks requiring a high degree of communication and cooperation are found to be most influenced by the team member with the lowest cognitive ability. Tasks in which selecting the best team member is the most successful strategy, are shown to be most influenced by the member with the highest cognitive ability. motivation and satisfaction on group performance.

Noteworthy is also that the involved researchers among the confirming findings widely overlap with each other and with the authors participating in the original first study around Anita Woolley.. This natural collective intelligence provides examples of how networks of interventions can cooperate to vastly or even exponentially increase their impact as compared to interventions that compete for impact on their own. Theoretically, this capacity for much greater impact on collective outcomes might be replicated to processes in human groups. Where a significant increase in collective intelligence is required for complex problems to be reliably solvable, creating the capacity to discover such networks might be critical in solving existentially important challenges. Where the collective intelligence community prioritizes the strategy of consensus-seeking , this is an issue. Consensus fails in its ability to select the networks of interventions that are potentially capable of this increase in collective impact, where such strategies are currently too new and potentially too disruptive for consensus to be possible.
