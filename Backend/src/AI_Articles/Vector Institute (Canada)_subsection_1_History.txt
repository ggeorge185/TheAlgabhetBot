Vector was established by Brendan Frey, Geoffrey Hinton, Raquel Urtasun in 2017 with the objectives of retaining and recruiting researchers in Toronto and encouraging companies to establish labs in the city.

On January 2, 2018, Garth Gibson became Vector's first president and CEO, and in 2023, would be replaced by Tony Gaffney. The institute was housed in the MaRS Discovery District and, in 2024, moved to the Schwartz Reisman Innovation Center.
