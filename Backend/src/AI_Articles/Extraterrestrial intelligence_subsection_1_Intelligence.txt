Intelligence is, along with the more precise concept of sapience, used to describe extraterrestrial life with similar Cognitive skill|cognitive abilities as humans. Another interchangeable term is ''wiktionary:sophont|sophoncy,'' first coined by Karen Anderson and published in the 1966 works by her husband Poul Anderson.

Sentience, like consciousness, is a concept sometimes mistakenly used to refer to the concept of extraterrestrial sapience and intelligence, since it does not exclude forms of life that are non-sapient.

The term ''extraterrestrial civilization'' frames a more particular case of extraterrestrial intelligence. It is the possible long-term result of intelligent and specifically sapient extraterrestrial life.
