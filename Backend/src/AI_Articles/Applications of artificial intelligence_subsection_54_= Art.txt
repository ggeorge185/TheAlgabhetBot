Main|Artificial intelligence art}}

AI has been used to produce visual art. The first AI art program, called AARON, was developed by Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen in 1968 with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing.
It started by creating simple black and white drawings, and later to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.

AI like "Disco Diffusion", "DALL-E|DALLÂ·E" (1 and 2), Imagen (Google Brain)|Imagen, "Dream by Wombo", Midjourney has been used for visualizing conceptual inputs such as song lyrics, certain texts or specific imagined concepts (or imaginations) in artistic ways or artistic images in general. Some of the tools also allow users to input images and various parameters e.g. to display an object or product in various environments, some can replicate artistic styles of popular artists, and some can create elaborate artistic images from rough sketches.

Since their design in 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used by AI artists. GAN computer programming, generates technical images through machine learning frameworks that surpass the need for human operators.
Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art. While distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork.

Researchers have also introduced models that predict emotional responses to art.
