Next to predicting a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks as shown in the original experiments,

Individual intelligence can be used to predict plenty of life outcomes from school attainment and career success to health outcomes and even mortality. (2008) showed that the relationship between individual IQ and success works only to a certain point and that additional IQ points over an estimate of IQ 120 do not translate into real life advantages. If a similar border exists for Group-IQ or if advantages are linear and infinite, has still to be explored. Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and collective intelligence exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over time or the question of improving intelligence. Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training, as well as watching drama movies. In how far such training ultimately improves collective intelligence through social sensitivity remains an open question.

There are further more advanced concepts and factor models attempting to explain individual cognitive ability including the categorization of intelligence in fluid and crystallized intelligence or the Three-stratum theory|hierarchical model of intelligence differences. Further supplementing explanations and conceptualizations for the factor structure of the '''Genomes''' of collective intelligence besides a general ''c'' factor', though, are missing yet.
