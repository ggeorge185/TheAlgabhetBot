Further|Artificial intelligence and copyright}}

The question of who owns the copyright to AI music outputs remain uncertain. When AI is used as a collaborative tool as a function of the human creative process, current US copyright laws are likely to apply. However, music outputs solely generated by AI are not granted copyright protection. In the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, the Copyright Office has stated that it would not grant copyrights to “works that lack human authorship” and “the Office will not register works produced by a machine or mere mechanical process that operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author.” In February 2022, the Copyright Review Board rejected an application to copyright AI-generated artwork on the basis that it "lacked the required human authorship necessary to sustain a claim in copyright."
