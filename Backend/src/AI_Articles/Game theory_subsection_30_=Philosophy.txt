Game theory has been put to several uses in philosophy. Responding to two papers by ,  used game theory to develop a philosophical account of Convention (norm)|convention. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge and employed it in analyzing play in coordination games. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand Meaning (semiotics)|meaning in terms of signaling games. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.<!----> Following  game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri (2006) have developed theories of social norms that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.

Game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive epistemology: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993), Brian Skyrms|Skyrms (1990), and Robert Stalnaker|Stalnaker (1999).

In ethics, some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton)  authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the prisoner's dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general social contract view in political philosophy (for examples, see  and ).

Other authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, stag hunt, and the Nash bargaining game as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g.,  and ).
