In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip during the 2023 Israelâ€“Hamas war, saying that Hamas "wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel." He added that "if you are not going to just outright commit a Palestinian genocide accusation|genocide, which will and should obviously not be acceptable by anyone, then you are going to leave a lot of people alive who subsequently hate Israel."

On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that users who use terms like "decolonization" and "from the river to the sea," or similar expressions that, according to him, imply genocide of the Israeli Jews|Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.
