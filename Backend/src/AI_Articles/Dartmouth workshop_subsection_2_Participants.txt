Initially, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Instead, after the workshop, McCarthy sent Solomonoff a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject. There were 47 people listed.

Solomonoff, however, made a complete list in his notes of the summer project:

# Ray Solomonoff
# Marvin Minsky
# John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy
# Claude Shannon
# Trenchard More
# Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nat Rochester
# Oliver Selfridge
# Julian Bigelow
# W. Ross Ashby
# W.S. McCulloch
# Abraham Robinson
# Tom Etter
# John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash
# David Sayre
# Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)|Arthur Samuel
# Kenneth R. Shoulders
# Shoulders' friend
# Alex Bernstein
# Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon
# Allen Newell 

Shannon attended Solomonoff's talk on July 10 and Bigelow gave a talk on August 15. Solomonoff doesn't mention Bernard Widrow, but apparently he visited, along with W.A. Clark and B.G. Farley. 

Ray Solomonoff, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the full-time. Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his three-week visit. From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions.
