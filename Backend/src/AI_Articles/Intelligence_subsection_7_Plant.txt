It has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their morphology (biology)|morphology, plant physiology|physiology and phenotypic plasticity|phenotype accordingly to ensure self-preservation and reproduction.

A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning. If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence, then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of "machine learning", but excludes those purely autonomic sense-reaction responses that can be observed in many plants. Plants are not limited to automated sensory-motor responses, however, they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of "learning" (registering memories) from their past experiences. They are also capable of communication, accurately computing their circumstances, using sophisticated costâ€“benefit analysis and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors.
