In November 2021, Lina Khan confirmed Whittaker joined the United States Federal Trade Commission as a senior advisor on artificial intelligence to the chair. Once announced as Signal's president, at the beginning of September 2022, she reported the ending of her term at the FTC.

The walkout was prompted by Google's reported $90 million payout to Andy Rubin, who had been accused of sexual misconduct, and the company's involvement with Project Maven. More than 3,000 Google employees signed a petition against Project Maven. Project Maven consisted of a contract between the US military and Google, in which Google was to develop machine vision technologies for the US drone program. Following the protests, Google did not renew the Maven contract.

She was part of the movement that called for Google to rethink their AI ethics council after the appointment of Kay Coles James, the president of The Heritage Foundation who has fought against LGBT protections. Whittaker claimed that she faced retaliation from Google, and wrote in an open letter that she had been told to "abandon her work" on enforcing ethics in technology at the AI Now Institute.

In a note shared internally following her resignation, Whittaker called for tech workers to "unionize in a way that works, protect conscientious objectors and whistleblowers, demand to know what you’re working on and how it’s used, and to build solidarity with other tech workers beyond your company."
