Some types of analogies can have a precise mathematical formulation through the concept of isomorphism. In detail, this means that if two mathematical structures are of the same type, an analogy between them can be thought of as a bijection which preserves some or all of the relevant structure. For example, <math> \mathbb^2 </math> and <math> \mathbb </math> are isomorphic as vector spaces, but the complex numbers, <math> \mathbb </math>, have more structure than <math> \mathbb^2 </math> does: <math> \mathbb </math> is a Field (mathematics)|field as well as a vector space.

Category theory takes the idea of mathematical analogy much further with the concept of functors. Given two categories C and D, a functor ''f'' from C to D can be thought of as an analogy between C and D, because ''f'' has to map objects of C to objects of D and arrows of C to arrows of D in such a way that the structure of their respective parts is preserved. This is similar to the #Shared structure|structure mapping theory of analogy of Dedre Gentner, because it formalises the idea of analogy as a function which makes certain conditions true.
