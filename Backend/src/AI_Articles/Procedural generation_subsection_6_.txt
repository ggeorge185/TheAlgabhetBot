Prior to graphically oriented video games, roguelike games, a genre directly inspired by ''Dungeons & Dragons'' adopted for solitaire play, heavily utilized procedural generation to randomly produce dungeons, in the same manner that tabletop systems had done. Such early games include ''Beneath Apple Manor'' (1978) and the genre's namesake, ''Rogue (video game)|Rogue'' (1980). The procedural generation system in roguelikes would create dungeons in ASCII- or regular tile-based systems and define rooms, hallways, monsters, and treasure to challenge the player. Roguelikes, and games based on the roguelike concepts, allow the development of complex gameplay without having to spend excessive time in creating a game's world.

1978's ''Maze Craze'' for the Atari VCS used an algorithm to generate a random, top-down maze for each game.

Some games used pseudorandom number generators. These PRNGs were often used with predefined Random seed|seed values in order to generate very large game worlds that appeared to be premade. ''The Sentinel (computer game)|The Sentinel'' supposedly had 10,000 different levels stored in only 48 and 64 kilobytes. An extreme case was ''Elite (video game)|Elite'', which was originally planned to contain a total of 2<sup>48</sup> (approximately 282 trillion) galaxies with 256 solar systems each. However, the publisher was afraid that such a gigantic universe would cause disbelief in players, and eight of these galaxies were chosen for the final version. Other notable early examples include the 1985 game ''Rescue on Fractalus'' that used fractals to procedurally create, in real time, the craggy mountains of an alien planet and ''River Raid'', the 1982 Activision game that used a pseudorandom number sequence generated by a linear feedback shift register in order to generate a scrolling maze of obstacles.
