In natural language processing, ANNs are vital for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. They have enabled the development of models that can accurately translate between languages, understand the context and sentiment in textual data, and categorize text based on content. This is because Deep Learning models are able to learn the style of an artist or musician from huge datasets and generate completely new artworks and music compositions. For instance, DALL-E is a deep neural network trained on 650 million pairs of images and texts across the internet that can create artworks based on text entered by the user. In the field of music, transformers are being used to create original music for commercials and documentaries through companies such as AIVA and Jukedeck. In the marketing industry generative models are being used to create personalized advertisements for consumers. Furthermore, neural networks have found uses in video game creation, where Non Player Characters (NPCs) can make decisions based on all the characters currently in the game.
