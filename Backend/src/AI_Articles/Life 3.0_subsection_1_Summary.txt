The book begins by positing a scenario in which AI has exceeded human intelligence and become pervasive in society. Tegmark refers to different stages of human life since its inception: Life 1.0 referring to biological origins, Life 2.0 referring to cultural developments in humanity, and Life 3.0 referring to the technological age of humans. The book focuses on "Life 3.0", and on emerging technology such as artificial general intelligence that may someday, in addition to being able to learn, be able to also redesign its own hardware and internal structure.

The first part of the book looks at the origin of intelligence billions of years ago and goes on to project the future development of intelligence. Tegmark considers short-term effects of the development of advanced technology, such as technological unemployment, Ethics of artificial intelligence|AI weapons, and the quest for human-level AGI (Artificial general intelligence|Artificial General Intelligence).  The book cites examples like DeepMind|Deepmind and OpenAI, Autonomous car|self-driving cars, and AI players that can defeat humans in Chess, Jeopardy, and Go.

After reviewing existing issues in AI, Tegmark then considers a range of possible futures that involve intelligent machines or humans. The fifth chapter describes a number of potential outcomes, such as altered social structures, integration of humans and machines, and both positive and negative scenarios like Friendly artificial intelligence|Friendly AI or an AI apocalypse. Tegmark argues that the risks of AI come not from malevolence or conscious behavior per se, but rather from the misalignment of the goals of AI with those of humans. Many of the goals of the book align with those of the Future of Life Institute, of which Tegmark is a co-founder.

The remaining chapters explore concepts in physics, goals, consciousness and meaning, and investigate what society can do to help create a desirable future for humanity.
