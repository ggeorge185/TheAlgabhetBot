Artificial Intelligence'' was originally titled ''Black Rose''. The title and some changes to the tracks delayed the album being released for five weeks.

Having produced Nico's sixth and final studio album ''Camera Obscura (album)|Camera Obscura'' (1985), Cale recorded this album in three weeks at Strongroom Studios with her backing band, the Faction, with a couple of additional musicians. The duo of Gill O'Donovan and
Susie O'List who performed backing vocals on this album had previously performed backing vocals on tours with Eurythmics.

Following the chaotic period during which the album (and the previous two) were recorded, John and Ris√© Irushalmi Cale's daughter Eden was born, which promptly caused Cale to kick his addictions to alcohol and cocaine, and to temporarily abandon recording studio albums and performing live in favour of other projects (until 1989's ''Words for the Dying'').
