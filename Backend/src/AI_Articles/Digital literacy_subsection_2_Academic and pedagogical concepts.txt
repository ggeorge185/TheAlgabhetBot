The pedagogy of digital literacy has begun to move across disciplines. while some literacy scholars have argued for expanding the framing beyond Information Communication Technologies and into literacy education overall.

Given the many varied implications that digital literacy has on students and educators, pedagogy has responded by emphasizing four specific models of engaging with digital mediums. Those four models are text-participating, code-breaking, text-analyzing, and text-using.  These methods present students (and other learners) with the ability to fully engage with the media, but also enhance the way the individual can relate to the digital text to their lived experiences.
