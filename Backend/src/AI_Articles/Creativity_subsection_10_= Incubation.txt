Main|Incubation (psychology)}}
Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight. Empirical research has investigated whether, as the concept of "incubation" in Graham Wallas|Wallas's model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Early work proposed that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks. 
This hypothesis is discussed in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi's five-phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time when your unconscious takes over. This was supposed to allow for unique connections to be made without our consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.

Ward lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with a different hypothesis: Incubation aids creative problem in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixation (psychology)|fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.
