In 2000, 123RF founder Andy Sitt left his job at a British company that sold stock images in Compact disc|CDs while showing customers printed catalogs. Andy launched his e-commerce business by setting up Inmagine, selling premium large-format photo prints. Working together with co-founder and current CEO Stephanie Sitt, Inmagine Group is one of the few technology companies to have bootstrapped globally from Asia.

From the beginning, Inmagine produced proprietary content which required in-house photographers, graphic designers, professional models, makeup artists, and a sales team to cater to demand.

In 2005, Inmagine set up 123RF, which offers royalty-free stock images, videos, and audio clips. Unlike the previous business model, 123RF allows photographers around the world to sell their work on the platform under a crowdsourcing model.

In 2011, Inmagine established a global presence with 44 regional offices worldwide. Offices were founded in North and Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Australasia.

In 2019, Inmagine consolidated and streamlined its offerings into three main products: 123RF, Pixlr, and Designs.ai. The launching of Pixlr Market (now Stock by Pixlr) and Pixlr Editor commences.

In 2020, the company launched its first artificial intelligence platform, Inmagine Brain. In November 2020, the company confirmed that it had been subject to a data breach, with 8.3 million customer records available for sale on the dark web.

Through 123RF, Inmagine created a visual guide in 2021 to predict image search trends.

In June 2022, the company launched its free images section where audiences can download images for free, but with only a limited amount of daily downloads.
