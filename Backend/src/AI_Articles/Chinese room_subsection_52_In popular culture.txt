The Chinese room argument is a central concept in Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts's novels ''Blindsight (Watts novel)|Blindsight'' and (to a lesser extent) ''Echopraxia (novel)|Echopraxia''. Greg Egan illustrates the concept succinctly (and somewhat horrifically) in his 1990 short story ''Learning to Be Me,'' in his collection ''Axiomatic (book)|Axiomatic''.

It is a central theme in the video game ''Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward'', and ties into the game's narrative. 

A similar human computer is imagined in Liu Cixin's novel ''The Three-Body Problem (novel)|The Three-Body Problem'', described thus by Philip Steiner: "a massive human-computer by instrumentalizing millions of soldiers [who] take the role of signal input and signal output and are instructed to perform different logical circuits, like an AND gate and an OR gate".}}
