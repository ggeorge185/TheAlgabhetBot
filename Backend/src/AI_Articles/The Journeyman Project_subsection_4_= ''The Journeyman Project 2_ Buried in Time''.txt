main|The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time}}

Published in 1995 by Sanctuary Woods, ''Buried in Time'' was a complete shift in direction for the series, moving away from futuristic environments and instead preferring to go to real-life historical locations. The game also featured a completely redesigned interface and contained many more live-action scenes than the first game.
