Morbid curiosity is focused on death, violence, or any other event that may cause harm physically or emotionally. It typically is described as having an addictive quality, associated with a need to understand or make sense of topics that surround harm, violence, or death. This can be attributed to one's need to relate unusual and often difficult circumstances to a primary emotion or experience of one's own, described as meta-emotions.

Interest in human curiosity about difficult circumstances dates back to Aristotle in his Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'', in which he noted, "We enjoy and admire paintings of objects that in themselves would annoy or disgust us."
