Skin surface microscopy started in 1663 by Johan Christophorous Kolhaus and was improved with the addition of immersion oil in 1878 by Ernst Abbe. The German dermatologist, Johann Saphier, added a built-in light source to the instrument. Leon Goldman was the first dermatologist to coin the term "dermascopy" and to use the dermatoscope to evaluate pigmented cutaneous lesions.

In 1989 dermatologists from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwigs-Maximilian-University of Munich developed a new device for dermoscopy. A team of physicians led by :de:Otto Braun-Falco|Professor Otto Braun-Falco in collaboration with the medical device manufacturer Heine Optotechnik|HEINE Optotechnik developed a dermatoscope, which was hand-held and illuminated by a halogen lamp. It also featured an achromatic lens with a 10-fold magnification. To reduce light reflection the lesion was covered with immersion oil. This dermatoscope helped to diagnose pigmented skin lesions more quickly and easily. The approach was confirmed by Wilhelm Stolz et al. from the Department of Dermatology and Allergology of the University of Munich and published in the "Lancet"(1989).

At the Medical University of Vienna a dermatoscope based on cross-polarization was [https://patents.google.com/patent/AU707671B2/ invented and patented], a methodology further used in digital dermatoscopes such as the Molemax|MoleMax device or by Fotofinder|FotoFinder. Following, in 2001, a California medical device manufacturer, 3Gen, introduced the first polarized handheld dermatoscope, the DermLite. Polarized illumination, coupled with a cross-polarised viewer, reduces (polarised) skin surface reflection, thus allowing visualisation of skin structures (the light from which is depolarised) without using an immersion fluid. Examination of several lesions is thus more convenient because physicians no longer have to stop and apply immersion oil, alcohol, or water to the skin before examining each lesion. With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin contact glass dermatoscope, they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass contact plate.

Due to the fairly standardised imaging, and limited amount of diagnoses compared to clinical dermatology, dermatoscopic images became one center of interest for automated medical image analysis. While in the past decades computer vision algorithms and hardware-based method were used large standardized public image collections such as HAM10000 enabled application of convolutional neural networks. 
The latter approach has now shown experimental evidence of human-level accuracy in larger/international,
 and smaller/local trials, but this application is not without dispute.
