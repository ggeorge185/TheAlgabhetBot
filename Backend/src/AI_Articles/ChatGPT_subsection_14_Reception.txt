OpenAI engineers say that they did not expect ChatGPT to be very successful and were surprised by the coverage and attention it received.

ChatGPT was widely assessed in December 2022 as having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities. Kevin Roose of ''The New York Times'' called it "the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public". Alex Kantrowitz of ''Slate (magazine)|Slate'' magazine lauded ChatGPT's pushback to questions related to Nazi Germany, including the statement that Adolf Hitler built highways in Germany, which was met with information about Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Nazi Germany's use of forced labor. In ''The Atlantic'' magazine's "Breakthroughs of the Year" for 2022, Derek Thompson (journalist)|Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of "the generative-AI eruption" that "may change our mind about how we work, how we think, and what human creativity is". Kelsey Piper of ''Vox (website)|Vox'' wrote that "ChatGPT is the general public's first hands-on introduction to how powerful modern AI has gotten, and as a result, many of us are [stunned]" and that ChatGPT is "smart enough to be useful despite its flaws".

ChatGPT's launch and popularity caught Google off guard, prompting a sweeping and unprecedented response in the ensuing months. In December 2022, Google executives sounded a "code red" alarm, fearing the threat of ChatGPT and Microsoft's collaboration with OpenAI to Google Search, Google's core business. After mobilizing its workforce, Google scrambled to launch Bard (chatbot)|Bard, a chatbot powered by the LaMDA LLM, in February, one day before Microsoft's Bing announcement. AI was the forefront of Google's annual Google I/O conference in May, announcing a slew of generative AI-powered features across List of Google products|its products to counter OpenAI and Microsoft.

Journalists have commented on ChatGPT's tendency to hallucinate. Mike Pearl of the online technology blog ''Mashable'' tested ChatGPT with multiple questions. In one example, he asked ChatGPT for "the largest country in Central America that isn't Mexico" (Mexico is in North America), to which ChatGPT responded with Guatemala (the correct answer is Nicaragua). When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to "Ballad of Dwight Fry", ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics. Writers for ''The Verge'', citing the work of Emily M. Bender, compared ChatGPT to a "stochastic parrot", as did Professor Anton Van Den Hengel of the Australian Institute for Machine Learning.

In December 2022, the question and answer website Stack Overflow banned the use of ChatGPT for generating answers to questions, citing the factually ambiguous nature of its responses. In January 2023, the International Conference on Machine Learning banned any undocumented use of ChatGPT or other large language models to generate any text in submitted papers. Samsung banned generative AI in May 2023 after sensitive material was uploaded to ChatGPT.

In January 2023, after being sent a song ChatGPT wrote in the style of Nick Cave, Cave responded on ''The Red Hand Files,'' saying the act of writing a song is "a blood and guts business [...] that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh idea. It requires my humanness." He went on to say, "With all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit, a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human, and, well, I don't much like it."

In February 2023, ''Time (magazine)|Time'' magazine placed a screenshot of a conversation with ChatGPT on its cover, writing that "The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything" and "The AI Arms Race Is On. Start Worrying".

Chinese state media have characterized ChatGPT as a way for the U.S. to "spread false information". In May 2023, Chinese police arrested a man who allegedly used ChatGPT to "fabricate false information." In December 2023, Chinese police arrested four people who had allegedly used ChatGPT to develop ransomware.

In late March 2023, the Italian data protection authority banned ChatGPT in Italy and opened an investigation. Italian regulators assert that ChatGPT was exposing minors to age-inappropriate content, and that OpenAI's use of ChatGPT conversations as training data could violate Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. In April 2023, the ChatGPT ban was lifted in Italy. OpenAI said it has taken steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised; an age verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least 13 years old. Additionally, users can access its privacy policy before registration.

In April 2023, Brian Hood, mayor of Shire of Hepburn|Hepburn Shire Council, planned to take legal action against ChatGPT over false information. According to Hood, ChatGPT erroneously claimed that he was jailed for bribery during his tenure at a subsidiary of Australia's national bank. In fact, Hood acted as a whistleblower and was not charged with any criminal offenses. His legal team sent a concerns notice to OpenAI as the first official step in filing a defamation case. In July 2023, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a civil investigative demand to OpenAI to investigate whether the company's data security and Information privacy|privacy practices to develop ChatGPT were Unfair business practices|unfair or Consumer protection|harmed consumers (including by Defamation|reputational harm) in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914.

In July 2023, the FTC launched an investigation into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, over allegations that the company scraped public data and published false and defamatory information. The FTC sent OpenAI a 20-page letter asking for comprehensive information about its technology and privacy safeguards, as well as any steps taken to prevent the recurrence of situations in which its chatbot generated false and derogatory content about people.

Research done in 2023 revealed weaknesses of ChatGPT that make it vulnerable to cyberattacks. A study presented example attacks on ChatGPT, including jailbreaks and reverse psychology. Additionally, malicious actors can use ChatGPT for Social engineering (security)|social engineering attacks and phishing attacks. The researchers also contended that ChatGPT and other generative AI tools have defense capabilities and the ability to improve security. The technology can improve security by cyber defense automation, threat intelligence, attack identification, and reporting.

There has been concern about copyright infringement involving ChatGPT. In June 2023, two writers sued OpenAI, saying the company's training data came from illegal websites that show copyrighted books. Comedian and author Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, and Richard Kadrey sued OpenAI and Meta Platforms|Meta for copyright infringement in July 2023. In December 2023, ''The New York Times'' sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, arguing that Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT could reproduce articles and/or sizable portions of these articles from the ''Times'' without permission. As part of the lawsuit, the ''Times'' has requested that OpenAI and Microsoft be prevented from using its content for training data, along with removing from training datasets.

In December 2023, ChatGPT became the first non-human to be included in Nature's 10|''Nature''<nowiki/>'s 10, an annual listicle curated by Nature (journal)|''Nature'' of people who make a significant impact in science.
