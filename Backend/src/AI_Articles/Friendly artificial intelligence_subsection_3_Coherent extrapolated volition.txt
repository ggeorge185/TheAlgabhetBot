Yudkowsky advances the Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) model. According to him, our coherent extrapolated volition is "our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted". The appeal to an evolutionary psychology|objective through contingent human nature (perhaps expressed, for mathematical purposes, in the form of a utility function or other decision theory|decision-theoretic formalism), as providing the ultimate criterion of "Friendliness", is an answer to the metaethics|meta-ethical problem of defining an moral universalism|objective morality; extrapolated volition is intended to be what humanity objectively would want, all things considered, but it can only be defined relative to the psychological and cognitive qualities of present-day, unextrapolated humanity.
