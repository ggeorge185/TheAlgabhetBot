File:Fallback in Behavior tree.png|thumb|right|Figure I. Graphical representation of a fallback composition of N tasks.

Fallback nodes are used to find and execute the first child that does not fail. A fallback node will return with a status code of success or running immediately when one of its children returns success or running (see Figure I and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order of importance, from left to right.

In pseudocode, the algorithm for a fallback composition is:

 1 '''for''' i from 1 to n '''do'''
 2     childstatus ‚Üê Tick(child(i))
 3     '''if''' childstatus = running
 4         '''return''' running
 5     '''else if''' childstatus = success
 6         '''return''' success
 7 '''end'''
 8 '''return''' failure
