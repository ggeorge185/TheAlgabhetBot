, a variable, or scalar, is a storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name (an ''''), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a ''''. The variable name is the usual way to  the stored value, in addition to referring to the variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer  can be Name binding|bound to a value during Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time, and the value of the variable may therefore change during the course of .}}
