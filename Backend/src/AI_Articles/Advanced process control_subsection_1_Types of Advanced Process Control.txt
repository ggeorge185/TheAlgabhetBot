Following is a list of well known types of advanced process control:

* Advanced regulatory control (ARC) refers to several proven advanced control techniques, such as override or adaptive gain (but in all cases, "regulating or feedback").  ARC is also a catch-all term used to refer to any customized or non-simple technique that does not fall into any other category.  ARCs are typically implemented using function blocks or custom programming capabilities at the DCS level.  In some cases, ARCs reside at the supervisory control computer level.
* Advanced process control (APC) refers to several proven advanced control techniques, such as feedforward, decoupling, and inferential control.  APC can also include Model Predictive Control, described below. APC is typically implemented using function blocks or custom programming capabilities at the DCS level.  In some cases, APC resides at the supervisory control computer level.
* Multivariable Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular technology, usually deployed on a supervisory control computer, that identifies important independent and dependent process variables and the dynamic relationships (models) between them, and often uses matrix-math based control and optimization algorithms to control multiple variables simultaneously.  One requirement of MPC is that the models must be linear across the operating range of the controller. MPC has been a prominent part of APC ever since supervisory computers first brought the necessary computational capabilities to control systems in the 1980s. 
* Nonlinear MPC: Similar to Multivariable MPC in that it incorporates dynamic models and matrix-math based control; however, it does not have the requirement for model linearity. Nonlinear MPC is capable of accommodating processes with models that have varying process gains and dynamics (i.e. dead-times and lag times).
* Inferential Measurements: The concept behind inferentials is to calculate a stream property from readily available process measurements, such as temperature and pressure, that otherwise might be too costly or time-consuming to measure directly in real time.  The accuracy of the inference can be periodically cross-checked with laboratory analysis.  Inferentials can be utilized in place of actual online analyzers, whether for operator information, cascaded to base-layer process controllers, or multivariable controller CVs.  
* Sequential control refers to discontinuous time- and event-based automation sequences that occur within continuous processes.  These may be implemented as a collection of time and logic function blocks, a custom algorithm, or using a formalized Sequential function chart methodology.
* Intelligent control is a class of Control theory|control techniques that use various artificial intelligence computing approaches like neural networks, Bayesian probability, fuzzy logic, machine learning, evolutionary computation and Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms.
