Financial magazine ''Forbes'' created a list of the leading disruptors in financial technology for its Forbes 2021 Global Fintech 50. In Europe there is a list called the FinTech 50, which aims to recognise the most innovative companies in fintech.

A report published in February 2016 by Ernst & Young|EY commissioned by the HM Treasury|UK Treasury compared seven leading fintech hubs: the United Kingdom, California, New York City, Singapore, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong. It ranked California first for 'talent' and 'capital', the United Kingdom first for 'government policy', and New York City first for 'demand'.

For the past few years, PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC has posted a report called the "Global Fintech Report". The 2019 report covers many topics of the financial technology sector, describing the landscape of the fintech industry, and some of the emerging technologies in the sector. And it provides strategies for financial institutions on how to incorporate more "fintech" technologies into their business.
