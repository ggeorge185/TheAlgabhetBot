Announced in 2016, Gym aims to provide an easily implemented Artificial general intelligence|general-intelligence Benchmark (computing)|benchmark over a wide variety of environmentsâ€”akin to, but broader than, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge used in supervised learning research. It hopes to standardize how environments are defined in AI research publications, so that published research becomes more easily reproducible. The project claims to provide the user with a simple interface. As of June2017, Gym can only be used with Python (programming language)|Python.
