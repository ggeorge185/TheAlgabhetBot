In anatomy, two anatomical structures are considered to be ''analogous'' when they serve similar role|functions but are not evolutionarily related, such as the Leg (anatomy)|legs of vertebrates and the legs of insects. Analogous structures are the result of convergent evolution|independent evolution and should be contrasted with structures which Homology (biology)|shared an evolutionary line.
