Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a [[factor analysis. Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor ''c'' underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a G factor (psychometrics)|general individual intelligence factor ''g'' typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.

A collective intelligence factor ''c'' in the sense of Woolley et al. in online gaming groups as well as in groups from different cultures and groups in different contexts in terms of short-term versus long-term groups.
