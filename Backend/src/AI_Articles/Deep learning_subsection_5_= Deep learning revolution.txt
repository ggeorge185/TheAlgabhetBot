In the late 2000s, deep learning started to outperform other methods in machine learning competitions.
In 2009, a long short-term memory trained by connectionist temporal classification (Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves, Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Jürgen Schmidhuber, 2006) Until 2011, CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al. at the leading conference CVPR In October 2012, the similar AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton further reduced the error rate and
won the ImageNet 2014 competition, following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition.

Image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of Automatic image annotation|generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.

In 2012, a team led by George E. Dahl won the "Merck Molecular Activity Challenge" using multi-task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug. In 2014, Sepp Hochreiter's group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs and won the "Tox21 Data Challenge" of NIH, FDA and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences|NCATS.

In 2016, Roger Parloff mentioned a "deep learning revolution" that has transformed the AI industry.

In March 2019, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.
