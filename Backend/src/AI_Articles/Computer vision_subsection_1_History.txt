In the late 1960s, computer vision began at universities that were pioneering artificial intelligence. It was meant to mimic the human visual system, as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior. by attaching a camera to a computer and having it "describe what it saw".
By the 1990s, some of the previous research topics became more active than others. Research in Projective geometry|projective 3D reconstruction|3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of Camera resectioning|camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse 3D reconstruction from multiple images|3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, Graph cuts in computer vision|variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, Morphing|image morphing, view interpolation, Image stitching|panoramic image stitching and early Light field|light-field rendering. 
The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods.
