main|Body armor}}

Body armor is seen throughout the ''Star Wars'' films, television shows and other media. Their main purpose is to protect the wearer from attacks and other hazards as in ancient and current times on Earth. They are most commonly seen on Imperial stormtroopers, clone troopers, bounty hunters and others, providing various levels of protection and other functions. According to ''Star Wars'' lore, the armor worn by stormtroopers is generally impervious to projectile weapons and blast shrapnel and can deflect a glancing blow from a Blaster (Star Wars)|blaster but will be punctured by a direct hit. Meanwhile, the traditional armor worn by Mandalorians, made from the fictional material known as beskar, is capable of repelling a lightsaber; though by the time the films take place in, most sets only had small amounts of beskar, which was alloyed with other metals. This was because most of the beskar in Mandalore's crust had mined out millennia prior.

Major characters in the ''Star Wars'' franchise are also known for wearing body armor. The bounty hunter Boba Fett wore modified body armor fitted with various gadgets like his predecessor, Jango Fett. This armor has multi-purpose tactical abilities along with many scrapes and dents which Fett wears with pride. Darth Vader wears an armored suit which protects him in combat as well as provides life-support functions for his badly burned body.

Such type of armor has slowly begun to become a scientific reality. In 2016, ballistic and body armor company, AR500, in collaboration with Heckler & Koch produced body armor modelled after the iconic villain, Boba Fett.
