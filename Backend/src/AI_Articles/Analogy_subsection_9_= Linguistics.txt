* An analogy can be the linguistics|linguistic process that reduces word forms thought to break rules to more common forms that follow these rules. For example, the English language|English verb ''wiktionary:help|help'' once had the preterite (simple past tense in English) ''holp'' and the past participle ''holpen''. These old-fashioned forms have been discarded and replaced by ''helped'' by using the power of analogy (or by applying the more frequently used Verb-''ed'' rule.) This is called morphological leveling. Analogies can sometimes create rule-breaking forms; one example is the Comparison of American and British English#Verb morphology|American English past tense form of ''wiktionary:dive|dive'': ''dove'', formed on analogy with words such as ''drive'': ''drove''.
* Neologisms can also be formed by analogy with existing words. A good example is ''software'', formed by analogy with ''computer hardware|hardware''; other analogous neologisms such as ''firmware'' and ''vaporware|vapourware'' have followed. Another example is the humorous term ''underwhelm'', formed by analogy with ''overwhelm''.
* Some people present analogy as an alternative to generative linguistics|generative ''rules'' for explaining the Productive (linguistics)|productive formation of structures such as words. Others argue that they are in fact the same and that rules are analogies that have essentially become standard parts of the linguistic system, whereas clearer cases of analogy have simply not (yet) done so (e.g. Langacker 1987.445â€“447). This view agrees with the current views of analogy in cognitive science which are discussed above.

Analogy is also a term used in the Neogrammarian school of thought as a Umbrella term|catch-all to describe any morphological change in a language that cannot be explained merely sound change or borrowing.
