Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense.  The use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may however meet some legal definitions of fraud.  "Plagiarism" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either Criminal law|criminal or Civil law (common law)|civil.  Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights.

Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement. Although both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).

Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases, acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for breach of contract|breach of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a civil wrong.
