For over a decade, Glaxo has used Cyc to semi-automatically integrate all the large (hundreds of thousands of terms) thesauri of pharmaceutical-industry terms that reflect differing usage across companies, countries, years, and sub-industries.  This ontology integration task requires domain knowledge, shallow semantic knowledge, but also arbitrarily deep common sense knowledge and reasoning.  Pharma vocabulary varies across countries, (sub-) industries, companies, departments, and decades of time.  E.g., what’s a'' gel pak''?  What’s the “street name” for ''ranitidine hydrochloride''?  Each of these ''n ''controlled vocabularies is an ontology with approximately 300k terms.  Glaxo researchers need to issue a query ''in their current vocabulary'', have it translated into a neutral “true meaning”, and then have that transformed in the opposite direction to find potential matches against documents each of which was written to comply with a particular known vocabulary.  They had been using a large staff to do that manually.  Cyc is used as the universal interlingua capable of representing the union of all the terms’ “true meanings”, and capable of representing the 300k transformations between each of those controlled vocabularies and Cyc, thereby converting an ''n²'' problem into a linear one without introducing the usual sort of “telephone game” attenuation of meaning.  Furthermore, creating each of those 300k mappings for each thesaurus is done in a largely automated fashion, by Cyc.
