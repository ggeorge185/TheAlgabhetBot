* 1965, H. A. Simon: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do."
* 1967, Marvin Minsky: "Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved."
* 1970, Marvin Minsky (in Life magazine|''Life'' Magazine): "In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being."
