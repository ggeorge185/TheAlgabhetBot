It was a preoccupation of the Greeks and Arabs (in the period between about 300&nbsp;BC and about 1200&nbsp;AD) to keep accurate track of time. In Ptolemaic Egypt, about 270&nbsp;BC, Ctesibius described a float regulator for a water clock, a device not unlike the ball and cock in a modern flush toilet. This was the earliest feedback-controlled mechanism. The appearance of the mechanical clock in the 14th century made the water clock and its feedback control system obsolete.

The History of Iran|Persian Banū Mūsā brothers, in their ''Book of Ingenious Devices'' (850&nbsp;AD), described a number of automatic controls. Two-step level controls for fluids, a form of discontinuous variable structure controls, were developed by the Banu Musa brothers. They also described a Control theory|feedback controller. The design of feedback control systems up through the Industrial Revolution was by trial-and-error, together with a great deal of engineering intuition. Thus, it was more of an art than a science. It was not until the mid-19th century that the stability of feedback control systems was analyzed using mathematics, the formal language of automatic control theory.

The centrifugal governor was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the seventeenth century, and used to adjust the gap between millstones.
