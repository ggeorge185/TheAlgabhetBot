AI alignment is often perceived as a fixed objective, but some researchers argue it is more appropriately viewed as an evolving process. As AI technologies advance and human values and preferences change, alignment solutions must also adapt dynamically. This dynamic nature of alignment has several implications:

* AI alignment solutions require continuous updating in response to AI advancements. A static, one-time alignment approach may not suffice.

* Alignment goals can evolve along with shifts in human values and priorities. Hence, the ongoing inclusion of diverse human perspectives is crucial.

* Varying historical contexts and technological landscapes may necessitate distinct alignment strategies. This calls for a flexible approach and responsiveness to changing conditions.

* The feasibility of a permanent, "fixed" alignment solution remains uncertain. This raises the potential need for continuous oversight of the AI-human relationship.

* Ethical development and deployment of AI are just as critical as the end goal. Ethical progress is necessary for genuine progress.
