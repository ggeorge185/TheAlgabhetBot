There is no specific definition of the term 'medical devices' in Indian law.  However, certain medical devices are notified as DRUGS under the Drugs & Cosmetics Act. Section 3 (b) (iv) relating to definition of "drugs" holds that  "Devices intended for internal or external use in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease or disorder in human beings or animals" are also drugs.  As of April 2022, 14 classes of devices are classified as drugs.
