Subject heading ''mind'' elaborates about cognitive science, with a couple of papers, and about David Hume|Hume with a third one. Subject heading ''matter'' addresses, through three papers, the relation between the intelligibility of mind and the material or physical. ''Meaning'' musters diverse papers all about the relationship between Human|us and the world and, finally, ''truth'' deals, by means of four papers, with Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity in terms of ''constitution'' as grounded in commitment.
