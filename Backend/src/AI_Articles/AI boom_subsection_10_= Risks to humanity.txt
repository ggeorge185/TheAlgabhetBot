Artificial intelligence}}Many experts have stated that the AI boom has started an arms race in which large companies are competing against each other to have the most powerful AI model on the market with little concern about safety. In particular, there have been concerns about the development of powerful models with speed and profit prioritized over safety and user protection. There have already been significant numbers of reports about racist, sexist, homophobic, and other types of discrimination from ChatGPT, Microsoft's Tay (chatbot)|Tay, and leading AI facial recognition models. It has been estimated that there are 80 to 120 researchers globally its potential for benefiting humanity, and sophistication, while other parties denounced it for Technological unemployment|threatening job security, and for giving 'uncanny valley|uncanny' or flawed responses.

In the midst of the AI boom, the hype surrounding artificial intelligence has been described as posing significant dangers. The enthusiasm and pressure generated by public fascination with AI can drive developers to expedite the creation and deployment of AI systems. This rush may lead to the omission of crucial safety procedures, potentially resulting in serious existential risks. As noted by Holden Karnofsky, the imperative competition to meet consumer expectations might tempt organizations to prioritize speed over thorough safety checks, thus jeopardizing the responsible development of AI.

The prevailing AI race mindset heightens the risks associated with the development of artificial general intelligence. While competition can foster innovation and progress, an intense race to outperform rivals may encourage the prioritization of short-term gains over long-term safety. A "winner-takes-all" mentality can further incentivize cutting corners, potentially creating a race to the bottom and compromising ethical considerations in responsible AI development.<ref name=":4" />

Prominent voices in the AI community have advocated for a cautious approach, urging AI companies to avoid unnecessary hype and acceleration.<ref name=":3" /> Concerns arise from the belief that pouring money into the AI sector too rapidly could lead to incautiousness from companies, as they race to develop transformative AI without due consideration for key risks.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":3" /> Despite prevailing hype and investment in AI, some argue that it is not too late to mitigate the risks associated with acceleration. Advocates for caution stress the importance of raising awareness about key risks, strong security procedures, and investing in AI safety measures, such as alignment research, standards, and monitoring.<ref name=":3" />
