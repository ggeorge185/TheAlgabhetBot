Categories in AIML form the fundamental unit of knowledge. A category consists of at least two further elements: the '''pattern''' and '''template''' elements. Here is a simple category:

<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
<category>
  <pattern>WHAT IS YOUR NAME</pattern>
  <template>My name is Michael N.S Evanious.</template>
</category>
</syntaxhighlight>

When this category is loaded, an AIML bot will respond to the input "What is your name" with the response "My name is Michael N.S Evanious."
