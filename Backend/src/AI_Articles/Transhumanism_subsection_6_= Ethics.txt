Humanism}}
Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on futurology and various fields of ethics. Unlike many philosophers, social critics and activists who place a moral value on preservation of nature|natural systems, transhumanists see the very concept of the specifically Appeal to nature|natural as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst. In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as Dan Agin, refer to transhumanism's critics, on the political right and left jointly, as "Bioconservatism|bioconservatives" or "neo-luddism|bioluddites", the latter term alluding to the 19th century luddite|anti-industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines. The idea of two human species, one being at a great physical and economic advantage in comparison with the other, is a troublesome one at best. One may be incapable of breeding with the other, and may by consequence of lower physical health and ability, be considered of a lower moral standing than the other. This view is reiterated by David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce, who advocates for the use of biotechnology to Eradication of suffering|eradicate suffering in all sentient beings.
