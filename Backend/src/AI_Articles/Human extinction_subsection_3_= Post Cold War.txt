John A. Leslie|John Leslie's 1996 book ''The End of The World'' was an academic treatment of the science and ethics of human extinction. In it, Leslie considered a range of threats to humanity and what they have in common. In 2003, British Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees published ''Our Final Hour'', in which he argues that advances in certain technologies create new threats to the survival of mankind and that the 21st century may be a critical moment in history when humanity's fate is decided. Edited by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. Ćirković, ''Global Catastrophic Risks (book)|Global Catastrophic Risks'' was published in 2008, a collection of essays from 26 academics on various global catastrophic and existential risks. Toby Ord's 2020 book ''The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity'' argues that preventing existential risks is one of the most important moral issues of our time. The book discusses, quantifies, and compares different existential risks, concluding that the greatest risks are presented by unaligned artificial intelligence and biotechnology.
