Schmidhuber received the Helmholtz Award of the International Neural Network Society in 2013, and the Neural Networks Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society in 2016 for "pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks." and gives credit to many even earlier AI pioneers. He admits that "the same tools that are now being used to improve lives can be used by bad actors," but emphasizes that "they can also be used against the bad actors."

He does not believe AI poses a "new quality of existential threat," and is more worried about the old nuclear warheads which can "wipe out human civilization within two hours, without any AI."  "A large nuclear warhead doesnâ€™t need fancy face recognition to kill an individual. No, it simply wipes out an entire city with 10 million inhabitants."
