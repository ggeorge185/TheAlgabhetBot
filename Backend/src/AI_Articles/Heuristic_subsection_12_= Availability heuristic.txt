According to Tversky and Kahneman (1973), the availability heuristic can be described as the tendency to consider events that they can remember with greater facilitation as more likely to occur than events that are more difficult to recall. An example of this would be asking someone whether they believe they are more likely to get bitten by a shark attack or die in a drowning incident. Someone may quickly answer with the incorrect belief that they are more likely to die from a shark attack as the event is more easily remembered, and is often covered more heavily than drowning deaths in the news. The correct answer is that people are more likely to die of drowning (1 in 1,134) than die after being bitten by a shark (1 in 4,332,817).
