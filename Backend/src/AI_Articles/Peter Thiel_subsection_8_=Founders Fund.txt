In 2005, Thiel created Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund. Other partners in the fund include Sean Parker, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek.

In addition to Facebook, Thiel made early-stage investments in numerous startups (personally or through Founders Fund), including Airbnb, LinkedIn, RapLeaf, Geni.com, Yammer, Yelp|Yelp Inc., Spotify, and AltSchool.

In 2017, Founders Fund bought about $15â€“20 million worth of bitcoin. In January 2018, the firm told investors that due to the cryptocurrency's surge the holdings were worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Also in 2017, Thiel was one of the first outside investors in Clearview AI, a Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology startup that has raised concerns in the tech world and media for its risks of weaponization.
