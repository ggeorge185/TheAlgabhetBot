In 2008, IBM representatives communicated with ''Jeopardy!'' executive producer Harry Friedman about the possibility of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two of the most successful contestants on the show, and the program's producers agreed. Watson's differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and ''Jeopardy!'' staff during the planning of the competition. IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the show's writers would exploit Watson's cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues, thereby turning the game into a Turing test. To alleviate that claim, a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast. Stephen L. Baker|Stephen Baker, a journalist who recorded Watson's development in his book ''Final Jeopardy'', reported that the conflict between IBM and ''Jeopardy!'' became so serious in May 2010 that the competition was almost cancelled.

To provide a physical presence in the televised games, Watson was represented by an "Avatar (computing)|avatar" of a globe, inspired by the IBM "smarter planet" symbol. Jennings described the computer's avatar as a "glowing blue ball crisscrossed by 'threads' of thoughtâ€”42 threads, to be precise", and stated that the number of thought threads in the avatar was an in-joke referencing the Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything (42)|significance of the 42 (number)|number 42 in Douglas Adams' ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''.
