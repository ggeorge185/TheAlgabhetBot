Main|Commonsense reasoning}}

Commonsense reasoning simulates the human ability to use commonsense knowledge to make presumptions about the type and essence of ordinary situations they encounter every day, and to change their "minds" should new information come to light.  This includes time, missing or incomplete information and cause and effect.  The ability to explain cause and effect is an important aspect of Explainable artificial intelligence|explainable AI.  Reason maintenance|Truth maintenance algorithms automatically provide an explanation facility because they create elaborate records of presumptions.  Compared with humans, all existing computer programs that attempt Artificial general intelligence|human-level AI perform extremely poorly on modern "commonsense reasoning" benchmark tests such as the Winograd Schema Challenge. The problem of attaining human-level competency at "commonsense knowledge" tasks is considered to probably be "AI complete" (that is, solving it would require the ability to synthesize a fully human-level intelligence),</ref> although some oppose this notion and believe compassionate intelligence is also required for human-level AI. Common sense reasoning has been applied successfully in more limited domains such as natural language processing and automated diagnosis or analysis.
