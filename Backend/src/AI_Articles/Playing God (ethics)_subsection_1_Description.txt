Playing God is a broad concept, which is encompassed by both theological and scientific topics. 
When the term is used, it can be used to refer to people who try to exercise great authority and power. It is usually pejorative and suggests arrogance, misappropriation of power, or tampering with matters in which humans should not meddle.
