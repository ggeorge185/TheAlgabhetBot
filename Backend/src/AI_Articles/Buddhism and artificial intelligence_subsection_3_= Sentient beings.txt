One major Buddhist goal is to remove suffering for all Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings, also known as the Bodhisattva vow. One question for Buddhist analysis of AI may concern how to relate principles to artificial systems that have been deemed sentient beings or how to develop such systems in ways that relate to Buddhist concepts. Perhaps, then, the main tasks of AI designers and developers may be two-fold: to set ethical and pragmatic goals for AI systems, and to fulfil the goals with AI in morally permissible manners. Promta and Himma say that applying Buddhist principles to accomplish these tasks may be possible and practical.

Prompta and Himmar say there are two prima-facie goals for creating artificially intelligent systems. The first goal is to create these systems, in such a way that maximally fulfils our crude sensory desires and worldly instincts of survival, just as we did for designing other tools in general. S. Promta et al. maintains that, it is possible that the majority of AI developers implicitly pursue this goal when they design AI machines, as can be observed by their over-scrutiny of superficial technicalities of these machines, instead of their wider functionalities.  The second goal, on the other hand, is to transcend these desires and  instincts. According to Buddhism, this goal is more worth pursuing than the former one. In ''Brahmajāla Sutta'', the Buddha holds that sensuality, as well as the beliefs and instincts they induce, are what confines beings to suffering.  Expounding his Four Noble Truths|four noble truths (Pali: ''cattāri ariyasaccāni'') in ''minor Malunkya Sutta'', the Buddha also takes eliminating suffering to be the first priority of human life.
