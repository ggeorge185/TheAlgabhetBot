Loeb has speculated that one type of technological equipment the project may detect could be "AI astronauts" and in 2021 – in an opinion piece – that AI "will" "supersede natural intelligence", while Martin Rees stated that there "may" be more civilizations than thought with the "majority of them" being artificial. In particular, Hypothetical technology|mid/far future or non-human applications of artificial intelligence could include advanced forms of artificial general intelligence that engages in space colonization or more narrow spaceflight-specific types of AI. In contrast, there have been concerns in relation to potential AGI or AI capable of embryo space colonization, or more generally natural intelligence-based space colonization, such as "safety of encounters with an alien AI", suffering risks (or inverse goals), moral license/responsibility in respect to colonization-effects, or AI gone rogue (e.g. as portrayed with fictional David 8|David<sup>8</sup> and HAL 9000). See also: space law and space ethics. Loeb has described the possibility of "AI astronauts" that engage in "supervised evolution" (see also: Directed evolution (transhumanism)|directed evolution, Uplift (science fiction)|uplift, directed panspermia and space colonization).
