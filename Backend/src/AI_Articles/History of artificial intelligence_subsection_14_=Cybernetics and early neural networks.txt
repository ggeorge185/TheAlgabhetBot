The earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an "electronic brain". Experimental robots such as W. Grey Walter's Turtle (robot)|turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast, were built in the 1950s. These machines did not use computers, digital electronics or symbolic reasoning; they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry.

Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI - though it is now lost. They were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network. The paper was influenced by Turing's earlier paper 'Turing's proof|On Computable Numbers' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function. Marvin Minsky|Minsky was to become one of the most important leaders and innovators in AI.
