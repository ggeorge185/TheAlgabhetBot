Main|Lights out (manufacturing)}}
Lights-out manufacturing is a production system with no human workers, to eliminate labor costs.

Lights out manufacturing grew in popularity in the U.S. when General Motors in 1982 implemented humans "hands-off" manufacturing to "replace risk-averse bureaucracy with automation and robots". However, the factory never reached full "lights out" status.

The expansion of lights out manufacturing requires:
* Reliability of equipment
* Long-term mechanic capabilities
* Planned preventive maintenance
* Commitment from the staff
