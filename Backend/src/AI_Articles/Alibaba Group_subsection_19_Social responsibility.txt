On 7 August 2021, Alibaba fired a manager who admitted to "indecent acts" with an inebriated employee. The case highlighted issues of sexual harassment in the workplace.

Alibaba actively promotes female employment, collaborating with the All-China Women's Federation for community e-commerce events. The company also donates to UN Women to support female employment initiatives. Half of Alibaba's employees are women, with one-third of leadership roles, especially in departments like human resources, held by women.
