The name ''Baidu'' () literally means "a hundred times", or alternatively, "countless times". It is a quote from the last line of Xin Qiji's () classical poem "Green Jade Table in The Lantern Festival" () saying: "Having searched hundreds of times in the crowd, suddenly turning back, she is there in the dimmest candlelight."
