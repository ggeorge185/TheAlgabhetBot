| Microsoft launched Kinect for Xbox 360, the first gaming device to track human body movement, using just a 3D camera and infra-red detection, enabling users to play their Xbox 360 wirelessly. The award-winning machine learning for human motion capture technology for this device was developed by the [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/vision/default.aspx Computer Vision group] at Microsoft Research#Laboratories|Microsoft Research, Cambridge.

| AlexNet, a deep learning model developed by Alex Krizhevsky, wins the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge with half as many errors as the second-place winner. This is a turning point in the history of AI; over the next few years dozens of other approaches to image recognition were abandoned in favor of deep learning. Krizhevsky is among the first to use GPU chips to train a deep learning network.

|Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Klaus Greff, and Juergen Schmidhuber used LSTM principles to create the Highway network, a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers, much deeper than previous networks. 7 months later, Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang;  Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun won the ImageNet 2015 competition with an open-gated Highway network variant called Residual neural network. This has become the most cited artificial neural network of the 21st century.

|Deepstack is the first published algorithm to beat human players in imperfect information games, as shown with statistical significance on heads-up no-limit poker. Soon after, the poker AI Libratus by different research group individually defeated each of its four-human opponents—among the best players in the world—at an exceptionally high aggregated winrate, over a statistically significant sample. In contrast to Chess and Go, Poker is an imperfect information game.
