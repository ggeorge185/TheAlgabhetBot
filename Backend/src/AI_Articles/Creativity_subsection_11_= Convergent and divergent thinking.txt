J. P. Guilford drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed convergent thinking|convergent and divergent thinking). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct or best solution to a problem (e.g., "How can we get a crewed rocket to land on the moon safely and within budget?"). Divergent thinking, on the other hand, involves creative generation of multiple answers to a open-ended prompt (e.g., "How can a chair be used?"). However, as Runco points out, there is a clear distinction between creative thinking and divergent thinking. Creative thinking focuses upon the production, combination, and assessment of ideas to formulate something new and unique while divergent thinking focuses on the act of conceiving of a variety of ideas which are not necessarily new or unique. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence, which are also roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity. While convergent and divergent thinking differ greatly in terms of approach to problem solving, it is believed that both are employed to some degree when solving most real-world problems. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts. Weisberg argued, by contrast, that creativity involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.
