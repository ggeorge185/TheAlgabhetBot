Reference material identifies a number of different methods by which energy is created in the ''Star Wars'' universe. Examples of power sources used for domestic devices include chemical, fission power|fission and fusion power|fusion reactors. In ''Star Wars'' spacecraft and other large structures, fusion reactors powered by the fictional "hypermatter" fuel are considered the most common source of energy. These fuels are typically hazardous to organic life, taking the form of corrosive liquids or poisonous gases.

Solar power technology is a method of energy generation used mainly by the Imperial TIE fighter, which features in many ''Star Wars'' films and other media. According to the ''TIE Fighter Owner's Workshop Manual'', these spacecraft are fitted with two hexagonal wings that have six trapezoidal solar arrays on both sides which collect energy from nearby stars and use it to power the fighter's ion engines. Another ''Star Wars'' ship noted for using solar power is the List of Star Wars spacecraft#Dooku's solar sailer|solar sailer piloted by Count Dooku (Christoper Lee) in ''Attack of the Clones'' and other media. It deploys a solar sail  wide which captures interstellar energy in order to travel without requiring fuel.

An electron transfer experiment conducted by scientists in 2005 involved a supramolecular TIE fighter ship design. It is unclear whether the experiment managed to achieve the desired results or not.
