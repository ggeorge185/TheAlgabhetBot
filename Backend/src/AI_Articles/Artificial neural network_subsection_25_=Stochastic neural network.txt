Stochastic neural networks''' originating from  Spin glass#Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model|Sherrington–Kirkpatrick models  are a type of artificial neural network built by introducing random variations into the network, either by giving the network's artificial neurons Stochastic process|stochastic transfer functions, or by giving them stochastic weights. This makes them useful tools for Optimization (mathematics)|optimization problems, since the random fluctuations help the network escape from Maxima and minima|local minima. Stochastic neural networks trained using a Bayesian approach are known as '''Bayesian neural networks'''.
