Marco Beltrami composed the original music film score "with only 17 days to render the finished work". It was scored for 95 orchestral musicians and 25 choral performers, The "Spiderbots" cue highlights ostinatos in meters such as 6/8 and 5/4 and reveals "Beltrami's trademark string writing which leads to an orchestral/choral finale." Erik Aadahl and Craig Berkey were the lead sound designers.
