Abductive reasoning allows inferring <math>a</math> as an explanation of <math>b</math>. As a result of this inference, abduction allows the precondition <math>a</math> to be abducted from the consequence <math>b</math>. Deductive reasoning and abductive reasoning thus differ in which end, left or right, of the proposition "<math>a</math> entailment|entails <math>b</math>" serves as conclusion. For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the ''eight'' ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that explains our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of prior probability|priors in Bayesian statistics.
