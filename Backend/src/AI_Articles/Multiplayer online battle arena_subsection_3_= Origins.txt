In the same year, Blizzard Entertainment released its best-selling real-time strategy game ''StarCraft'' (1998) with a suite of game editing tools called ''StarEdit''. These tools allowed players to design and create custom maps with non-standard rules and gameplay. A modder known as Aeon64 made a custom map named ''Aeon of Strife'' (''AoS'') that became popular. Some of the key features introduced in ''AoS'' became the foundation of the newborn genre.
In the ''Aeon of Strife'' map, players controlled a single powerful hero unit fighting along three lanes which were protected by defensive towers. The terrain outside these lanes was nearly vacant. In early versions of the game, hero units did not have any particular special abilities. Instead, players spent gold on weapon and armor upgrades.
It was rumored that the modder was attempting to create gameplay similar to that of ''Future Cop: LAPD''s Precinct Assault mode.
