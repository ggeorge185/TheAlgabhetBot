In Spring 2012, Thiel taught CS 183: Startup at Stanford University. Notes for the course, taken by student Blake Masters, led to a book titled ''Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future'' by Thiel and Masters, which was released in September 2014. (Thiel would later go on to endorse Masters' campaign in the 2022 United States Senate election in Arizona and spend more than $10 million in its support.)

Derek Thompson, writing for ''The Atlantic'', stated ''Zero to One'' "might be the best business book I've read". He described it as a "self-help book for entrepreneurs, bursting with bromides" but also as a "lucid and profound articulation of capitalism and success in the 21st century economy."
