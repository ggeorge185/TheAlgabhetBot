In January 2023, ''Futurism.com'' broke the story that CNET had been using an undisclosed internal AI tool to write at least 77 of its stories; after the news broke, CNET posted corrections to 41 of the stories.

In April 2023, the German tabloid ''Die Aktuelle'' published a fake AI-generated interview with former racing driver Michael Schumacher, who had not made any public appearances since 2013 after sustaining a brain injury in a skiing accident. The story included two possible disclosures: the cover included the line "deceptively real", and the interview included an acknowledgment at the end that it was AI-generated. The editor-in-chief was fired shortly thereafter amid the controversy.

Other outlets that have published articles whose content and/or byline have been confirmed or suspected to be created by generative AI models â€“ often with false content, errors, and/or non-disclosure of generative AI use - include NewsBreak, outlets owned by Arena Group (Sports Illustrated, TheStreet,), B&H Photo, outlets owned by Gannett (The Columbus Dispatch, Reviewed (website)|Reviewed), MSN, News Corp, outlets owned by G/O Media (Gizmodo, Jalopnik,), The Irish Times, outlets owned by Red Ventures (Bankrate), and BuzzFeed.

In response to potential pitfalls around the use and misuse of generative AI in journalism, outlets such as Wired (magazine)|Wired, Associated Press|The Associated Press and The Guardian have published guidelines around how they plan to use and not use generative AI in their work.
