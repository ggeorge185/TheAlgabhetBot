Simulating entities in a virtual environment requires simulating the entire process that goes from a perception of the environment, or more generally from a stimulus, to an action on the environment. This process is called the AI loop and technology used to simulate it can be subdivided in two categories. ''Sensorimotor or low-level'' AI deals with either the perception problem (what is perceived?) or the animation problem (how are actions executed?). ''Decisional or high-level'' AI deals with the action selection problem (what is the most appropriate action in response to a given perception, i.e. what is the most appropriate behavior?).
