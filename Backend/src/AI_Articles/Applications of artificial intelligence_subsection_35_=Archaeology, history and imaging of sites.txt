Machine learning can help to restore and attribute ancient texts. It can help to index texts for example to enable better and easier searching and classification of fragments.

Artificial intelligence can also be used to investigate genomes to uncover genetic history, such as interbreeding between archaic and modern humans by which for example the past existence of a ghost population, not Neanderthal or Denisovan, was inferred. 

It can also be used for "non-invasive and non-destructive access to internal structures of archaeological remains".
