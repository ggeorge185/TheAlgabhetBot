In addition to basic string functionality, SAIL included a string scanner system as part of the basic language.  worked on string variables, while the otherwise similar  was used to scan strings being read from a file. Both used a system known as a "break table" which consisted of a set of characters that represented places to stop reading, examples include linefeeds, various whitespace, and punctuation. These tables were stored in special structures, and the system allowed only 54 of these, a number that is not explained in the documentation.

To build a new table, one first called  which returned the next free slot in the table, or "table number". This would be followed by a , which took the table number, a string with the break characters, another string of "omit characters" which were simply ignored during reading (as if they were not in the string) and finally the "modes", flags that indicated how the system should work. Once set, the program could then repeatedly call  or  and be returned complete strings. This included a reference parameter, normally brkchar, that contained the character that caused the break, allowing one to test, for instance, for end-of-file characters. The system is conceptually similar to C's  functionality, which is part of stdlib as opposed to being part of the language itself as in SAIL.
