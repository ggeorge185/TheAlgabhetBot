In transhumanism and futurology, superhuman abilities are the technological aim either of human enhancement by Genetic engineering|genetic modification or Cyberware|cybernetic implants or of future Superintelligence|superhuman artificial intelligence.

Human enhancement is an attempt to temporarily or permanently overcome the current limitations of the human body through natural or artificial means. Human enhancement may be through the use of technological means to select or alter human characteristics and capacities, whether or not the alteration results in characteristics and capacities that lie beyond the existing human range.

Some bioethicists restrict the term to the non-therapeutic application of Human enhancement#Technologies|specific technologies — Neurotechnology|neuro-, cyberware|cyber-, gene therapy|gene- and nanomedicine|nano-technologies — to human biology.

According to transhumanist thinkers, a posthuman is a hypothetical future being "''whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously human by our current standards.''"

Fictionalized accounts of transhumanism include the characters from the ''X-Men'' franchise and cyborgs such as those found in the ''Ghost in the Shell'' franchise.
