 which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the Feasible region|search space of a problem , either with Continuous or discrete variable|discrete or continuous values.}}














. It is considered the highest level of isolation (computer science)|isolation between Database transaction|transactions, and plays an essential role in concurrency control. As such it is supported in all general purpose database systems. ''Two-phase locking|Strong strict two-phase locking'' (SS2PL) is a popular serializability mechanism utilized in most of the database systems (in various variants) since their early days in the 1970s.

, which adds an element to the collection, and 
* , which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek (data type operation)|peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack. The name "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other. This structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.}}











Subroutines may be defined within programs, or separately in library (computer science)|libraries that can be used by many programs.  In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a routine, subprogram, function, method (computing)|method, or procedure. Technically, these terms all have different definitions. The generic, umbrella term  callable unit is sometimes used.}}
