Eastern religions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism recognise non-humans as sentient beings. The term ''sentient beings'' is translated from various Sanskrit terms (''jantu, bahu jana, jagat, sattva'') and "conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion, suffering, and rebirth (Saṃsāra)". In some forms of Buddhism plants, stones and other inanimate objects are considered to be 'sentient'. In Jainism many things are endowed with a soul, ''Jīva (Jainism)|jīva'', which is sometimes translated as 'sentience'. Some things are without a soul, ''ajiva|ajīva'', such as a chair or spoon. There are different rankings of ''jīva'' based on the number of senses it has. Water, for example, is a sentient being of the first order, as it is considered to possess only one sense, that of touch.

In Jainism and Hinduism, this is related to the concept of ahimsa, non-violence toward other beings.

Sentient beings (Buddhism)|Sentience in Buddhism is the state of having senses. In Buddhism, there are six senses, the sixth being the subjective experience of the mind. Sentience is simply awareness prior to the arising of Skandha. Thus, an animal qualifies as a sentient being. According to Buddhism, sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible. In Mahayana Buddhism, which includes Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, the concept is related to the Bodhisattva, an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others. The first Bodhisattva vows|vow of a Bodhisattva states, "Sentient beings are numberless; I vow to free them."
