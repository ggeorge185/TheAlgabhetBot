AlphaGo's victory was a major milestone in artificial intelligence research. Go had previously been regarded as a hard problem in machine learning that was expected to be out of reach for the technology of the time. Most experts thought a Go program as powerful as AlphaGo was at least five years away; some experts thought that it would take at least another decade before computers would beat Go champions. Most observers at the beginning of the 2016 matches expected Lee to beat AlphaGo. Some commentators believe AlphaGo's victory makes for a good opportunity for society to start discussing preparations for the possible future impact of artificial general intelligence|machines with general purpose intelligence.  In March 2016, AI researcher Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell stated that "AI methods are progressing much faster than expected, (which) makes the question of the long-term outcome more urgent," adding that "in order to ensure that increasingly powerful AI systems remain completely under human control... there is a lot of work to do." Some scholars, such as physicist Stephen Hawking, warn that some future self-improving AI could gain actual general intelligence, leading to an unexpected AI takeover;<!-- and says "I don't see why we would speak about fears. On the contrary, this raises hopes in many domains such as health and space exploration."

The DeepMind AlphaGo Team received the Inaugural IJCAI Marvin Minsky Medal for Outstanding Achievements in AI. "AlphaGo is a wonderful achievement, and a perfect example of what the Minsky Medal was initiated to recognise", said Professor Michael Wooldridge (computer scientist)|Michael Wooldridge, Chair of the IJCAI Awards Committee.  "What particularly impressed IJCAI was that AlphaGo achieves what it does through a brilliant combination of classic AI techniques as well as the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that DeepMind is so closely associated with. Itâ€™s a breathtaking demonstration of contemporary AI, and we are delighted to be able to recognise it with this award".
