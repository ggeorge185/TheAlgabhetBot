A number of purported AI image detection software exists, to detect AI-generated images (for example, those originating from Midjourney or DALL-E). They are not completely reliable. 

Others claim to identify video and audio deepfakes, but this technology is also not fully reliable yet either. 

Despite debate around the efficacy of watermarking, Google DeepMind is actively developing a detection software called SynthID, which works by inserting a digital watermark that is invisible to the human eye into the pixels of an image.
