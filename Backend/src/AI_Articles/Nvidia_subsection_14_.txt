While the Maxwell series was marketed as fully DirectX 12 compliant, Oxide Games, developer of ''Ashes of the Singularity'', uncovered that Maxwell-based cards do not perform well when async compute is utilized. Nvidia partially implemented it through a driver-based Shim (computing)|shim, coming at a high performance cost. Nvidia planned to rely on the driver to implement a software queue and a software distributor to forward asynchronous tasks to the hardware schedulers, capable of distributing the workload to the correct units. Asynchronous compute on Maxwell therefore requires that both a game and the GPU driver be specifically coded for asynchronous compute on Maxwell in order to enable this capability. The 3DMark Time Spy benchmark shows no noticeable performance difference between asynchronous compute being enabled or disabled. Each partition is assigned to a hardware queue. If any of the queues that are assigned to a partition empty out or are unable to submit work for any reason (e.g. a task in the queue must be delayed until a Hazard (computer architecture)|hazard is resolved), the partition and all of the resources in that partition reserved for that queue will idle. The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being an anti-competitive practice.
