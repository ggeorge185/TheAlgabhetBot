Rotten Tomatoes prose|30|4.9|135|consensus=Gal Gadot remains an entertaining action star, but she's no match for ''Heart of Stone's'' thinly written characters, generic plot, and rote set pieces.|access-date=October 7, 2023|ref=y}} 

Time (magazine)|''Time'''s Stephanie Zacharek said the film "occupies that vast middle zone of small-screen movies that easily fill the void of a few empty hours, if you happen to have any to spare, though it's nothing you'd carve out time in your schedule to watch." Brian Lowry of CNN said it "capitalizes on Gadot's inherent likability – a ruthless agent burdened by, yes, a heart – without bringing enough distinctive elements to this exercise to make it feel like much more than a ''Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission'' wannabe." The Independent|''The Independent'''s Clarisse Loughrey gave it two out of five stars, writing, "Heart of Stone is an ideological mess. AI is great until it's not, and then it's fine because Gal Gadot can just kick someone in the face. It's conflicted without embracing that conflict, resulting in a film that's really about nothing at all."

Wendy Ide of The Observer|''The Observer'' gave it three out of five stars, calling the screenplay "a rudimentary thing – scaffolding to support the set pieces – that starts to creak whenever it attempts any depth of character", but praising the action as "terrific, with a screaming, tyre-shredding extended car chase around Lisbon's tight, cobbled alleys a breathless and exhilarating highlight." Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times|''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave it three out of four stars, writing, "''Heart of Stone'' is clearly intended to jump-start an action franchise for Gadot, and it's off to a promising start."
