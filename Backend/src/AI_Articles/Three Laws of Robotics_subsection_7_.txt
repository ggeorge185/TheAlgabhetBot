In "Little Lost Robot" several NS-2, or "Nestor", robots are created with only part of the First Law. however, the character Susan Calvin articulates the concept in the short story "The Evitable Conflict".

In the final scenes of the novel ''Robots and Empire'', R. Giskard Reventlov is the first robot to act according to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is telepathic, like the robot Herbie in the short story "Liar! (short story)|Liar!", and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of "harm" than most robots can grasp. However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings if he can do so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard's brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure metacognition. Although he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice will turn out to be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law.

Daneel originally formulated the Zeroth Law in both the novel ''Foundation and Earth'' (1986) and the subsequent novel ''Prelude to Foundation'' (1988):



A condition stating that the Zeroth Law must not be broken was added to the original Three Laws, although Asimov recognized the difficulty such a law would pose in practice. Asimov's novel ''Foundation and Earth'' contains the following passage:



A translator incorporated the concept of the Zeroth Law into one of Asimov's novels before Asimov himself made the law explicit.}}
