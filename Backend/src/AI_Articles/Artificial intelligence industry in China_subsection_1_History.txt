The research and development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in China started in the 1980s, with the announcement by Deng Xiaoping of the importance of science and technology for China's economic growth. Despite starting relatively late, Chinese AI development has achieved significant milestones in recent years, making it a notable contributor in both research and application of the AI field. It is noteworthy that Chinese policies have played a crucial role in driving AI advancement from the beginning, with AI being a significant part of China's national technology plan.
