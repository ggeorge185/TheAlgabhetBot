Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book ''The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age''.

The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as "allies" and move from a transactional approach to employment to a "relational" one.

The book became a ''New York Times'' bestseller. Arianna Huffington named ''The Alliance'' "the must-read book of the summer" in 2014. A Financial Times review was mixed, noting that those who aren't well-versed on the changing nature of the workplace may find the book useful, but readers looking for more surprising or in-depth insights will be disappointed.
