Artificial neural networks in bioinformatics have been used for:

* Comparing and aligning RNA, protein, and DNA sequences.
* Identification of promoters and finding genes from sequences related to DNA.
* Interpreting the expression-gene and micro-array data.
* Identifying the network (regulatory) of genes.
* Learning evolutionary relationships by constructing phylogenetic trees.
* Classifying and predicting protein structure.
* Molecular modelling|Molecular design and Docking (molecular)|docking.
