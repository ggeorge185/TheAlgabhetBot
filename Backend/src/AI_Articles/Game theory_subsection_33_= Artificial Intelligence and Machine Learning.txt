Game theory has multiple applications in the field of AI/ML. It is often used in developing autonomous systems that can make complex decisions in uncertain environment. Some other areas of application of game theory in AI/ML context are as follows - multi-agent system formation, reinforcement learning, mechanism design etc. By using game theory to model the behavior of other agents and anticipate their actions, AI/ML systems can make better decisions and operate more effectively.
