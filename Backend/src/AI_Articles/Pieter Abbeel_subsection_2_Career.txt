Upon his arrival at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor, Abbeel founded the Berkeley Robot Learning Lab. Additionally, in 2014, he co-founded Gradescope with other UC Berkeley-affiliated engineers Arjun Singh, Sergey Karayev, Ibrahim Awwal, which was acquired by TurnItIn in 2018.  In 2016, Abbeel joined OpenAI, where he has published numerous articles on reinforcement learning, robot learning, and unsupervised learning. Also in 2016, he became co-director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab, which consists of post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students interested in machine learning and robotics. He also founded Berkeley Open Arms, which has licenses the IP on the Blue Robot project from Berkeley. In 2017, he became a full-time professor with tenure at UC Berkeley.

In October 2017, Abbeel and three of his students, Peter Chen, Rocky Duan, and Tianhao Zhang, co-founded Covariant (formerly named Embodied Intelligence). Based in Emeryville, California,  Covariant launched in January 2020 and was covered in, among others, New York Times, Wired, MIT Technology Review, and IEEE Spectrum.  The company currently has $147M in funding. The website discloses that the team is building a universal AI to help robots see, reason, and on the world around them using deep imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning. Currently, in addition to his research, Abbeel teaches upper-division and graduate classes on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Deep Unsupervised Learning. Abbeel also hosts a weekly podcast, The Robot Brains, featuring experts in AI and robotics.
