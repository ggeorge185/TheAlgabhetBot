One modern day method of achieving above average abilities include performance-enhancing drugs; these include substances such as Analgesic|painkillers, Blood doping|blood boosters, stimulants, and anabolic steroids, but can also encompass substances that are not fully recognized as enhancers such as caffeine, protein supplements, and vitamins. While drugs as a form of achieving superhuman capabilities is a well known concept in fiction, such as films like ''Limitless (film)|Limitless'' and the Marvel Comics character Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke, in real life the current substances that are known and available do not produce such fantastical abilities. The results from some of these drugs are minimal, and often short term. However, they can still produce Anabolic-androgenic steroids abuse|detrimental side effects, including many adverse psychological effects. SARMS and Methylhexanamine|DMAA are safer forms to enhance physical performance. Other forms of enhancement include strengthening the material properties of bone by integrating it with titanium foam. More studies are needed to assess the long term effects of these emerging technologies.

Technology can also be used to improve on human sensory and communication abilities as has been shown through experimentation with nervous system implants. In this way humans can take on senses such as ultrasonics for an accurate indication of distance and communicate much more directly between brains.
