Recruitment involves the identification of potential applicants and the marketing of positions. AI is commonly utilized in the recruitment process because it can help boost the number of qualified applicants for positions.  Companies are able to use AI to target their marketing to applicants who are likely to be good fits for a position. This often involves the use of social media sites advertising tools, which rely on AI. Facebook allows advertisers to target ads based on demographics, location, interests, behavior, and connections. Facebook also allows companies to target a "look-a-like" audience, that is the company supplies Facebook with a data set, typically the company's current employees, and Facebook will target the ad to profiles that are similar to the profiles in the data set. Additionally, job sites like Indeed, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter target job listings to applicants that have certain characteristics employers are looking for. Targeted advertising has many advantages for companies trying to recruit such being a more efficient use of resources, reaching a desired audience, and boosting qualified applicants. This has helped make it a mainstay in modern hiring. Video interviews utilize AII and have become prevalent. Zappyhire, a recruitment automation startup has developed a recruitment bot, that assures that you engage with the most relevant candidates by using chatbot's AI-powered resume screening technology. HireVue has created technology that analyzes interviewees responses and gestures during recorded video interviews. Over 12 million interviewees have been screened by the over 700 companies that utilize the service. AI is only as good as the data it is using. Biases can inadvertently be baked into the data used in AI.
