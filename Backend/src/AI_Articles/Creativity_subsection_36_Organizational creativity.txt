Various research studies set out to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself – how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Teresa Amabile, argue that to enhance creativity in business, three components are needed:
# Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge)
# Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems)
# Motivation (especially intrinsic motivation)

There are two types of motivation:
* Motivation|extrinsic motivation – Externality|external factors, for example threats of being fired or money as a reward,
* intrinsic motivation – comes from inside an individual: satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.
According to Amabile, people are more creative when their motivation is intrinsic. Indeed, research has shown that extrinsic motivators can undermine intrinsic motivation.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
# Challenge – matching people with the right assignments
# Freedom – giving people autonomy in choosing means to achieve goals
# Resources – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance among resources and people
# Work group features – Cultural diversity|diverse, supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents
# Supervisory encouragement – recognition, cheering, praising
# Organizational support – , information sharing, collaboration

Ikujiro Nonaka, an organizational theorist who has examined several successful Japanese companies, saw that creativity and knowledge creation were important to the success of organizations. In particular, he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has in the creative process.

In business, however, originality is not enough. An idea must also be appropriate – useful and Cause of action|actionable. Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence solves this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to the innovation process and links competitive intelligence to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and affects economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists (who research factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations) have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture. These theoretical models also emphasize the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso, and micro. Macro studies are at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organizations. Micro investigations center on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses, economics, education, human resource management, knowledge and organizational management, sociology, psychology, knowledge economy-related sectors – especially software, and advertising.

Sai Loo conducted a study on creative work in the knowledge economy. This investigation focused on how workers in the advertising and IT software sectors leverage their creativity and expertise. The study observed this phenomenon in three developed countries: England, Japan, and Singapore, offering global perspectives. Loo's research is based on qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with professionals in roles such as creative directing, copywriting (in advertising), and systems software development and program management. management, sociology, and psychology.

Themes derived from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature establish a theoretical framework for creative knowledge work. In science, technology, or cultural industries, these workers utilize their cognitive abilities, creative attributes, and skill sets to conceive new possibilities, such as media, products, or services.These activities can be carried out individually or collaboratively. Achieving these creative tasks requires education, training, and "encultured environments." Creative acts involve posing new questions beyond those asked by intelligent individuals, pursuing novelty when evaluating a situation, and generating distinct and innovative outcomes—variations on existing ideas within a specific domain.

This investigation outlines a definition of creative work, identifies three work types, and highlights the essential conditions for its occurrence. Creative workers employ various creative tools, including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, idea generation, and aesthetic sensibilities. Aesthetic sensibilities, for example, differ based on the sector, like visual imagery for creative directors in advertising or innovative technical expertise for software programmers. Specific applications also exist within sectors, such as emotional connection in advertising and power of expression in software. Apart from creative tools, creative workers need pertinent skills and aptitudes.  For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment, and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music), and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences, and physical sciences). In software, technical knowledge of computer languages is significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager.

There are three work types. The first is intra-sectoral, exemplified by terms like 'general sponge' and 'in tune with the zeitgeist' (advertising), or 'power of expression' and 'sensitivity' (software). The second is inter-sectoral, such as 'integration of advertising activities' (advertising) or 'autonomous decentralized systems (ADS)' (software). The third type involves cultural/practice changes in sectors, like 'three-dimensional trust' and 'green credentials' (advertising), or 'collaboration with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and industry' and 'ADS system in the Tokyo train operator' (software).

For creative work to thrive, essential conditions include a supportive environment comprising information, communications, and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, along with training, work environment, and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Educational institutions should provide interdisciplinary knowledge in humanities, arts, and sciences, influencing program structures, delivery methods, and assessments. On a larger scale, governments should offer diverse cultural, outdoor, and sports activities to inspire potential creative workers in fields like video gaming and advertising. For work organizations, the study suggests promoting collaborative and individual work, facilitating continuous professional development, and creating an environment conducive to experiential learning and experimentation.
