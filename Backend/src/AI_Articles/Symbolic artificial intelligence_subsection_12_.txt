Main|neats vs. scruffies}}

Researchers at MIT (such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert) found that solving difficult problems in computer vision|vision and natural language processing required ad hoc solutionsâ€”they argued that no simple and general principle (like logic) would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. Roger Schank described their "anti-logic" approaches as "Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy" (as opposed to the "neats vs. scruffies|neat" paradigms at Carnegie Mellon University|CMU and Stanford).
Commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat's Cyc) are an example of "scruffy" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.
