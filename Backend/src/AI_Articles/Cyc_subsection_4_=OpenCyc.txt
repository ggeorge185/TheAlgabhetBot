The first version of OpenCyc was released in spring 2002 and contained only 6,000 concepts and 60,000 facts.  The knowledge base was released under the Apache License. Cycorp stated its intention to release OpenCyc under parallel, unrestricted licences to meet the needs of its users. The CycL and SubL interpreter (the program that allows users to browse and edit the database as well as to draw inferences) was released free of charge, but only as a binary, without source code. It was made available for Linux and Microsoft Windows. The open source Texai project released the Resource Description Framework|RDF-compatible content extracted from OpenCyc.  A version of OpenCyc, 4.0, was released in June 2012. OpenCyc 4.0 included much of the Cyc ontology at that time, containing hundreds of thousands of terms, along with millions of assertions relating the terms to each other; however, these are mainly taxonomic assertions, not the complex rules available in Cyc. The OpenCyc 4.0 knowledge base contained 239,000 concepts and 2,093,000 facts.

The main point of releasing OpenCyc was to help AI researchers understand what was ''missing'' from what they now call Ontology (information science)|ontologies and knowledge graphs.  It's useful and important to have properly taxonomized concepts like person, night, sleep, lying down, waking, happy, etc., but what's ''missing'' from the OpenCyc content about those terms, but present in the Cyc KB content, are the various rules of thumb that most of us share about those terms: that (as a default, in the ModernWesternHumanCultureMt) each person sleeps at night, sleeps lying down, can be woken up, is not happy about being woken up, ''and so on.''  That point does not require continually-updated releases of OpenCyc, so, as of 2017, OpenCyc is no longer available.
