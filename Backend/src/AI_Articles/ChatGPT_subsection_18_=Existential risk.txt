A May 2023 Statement on AI risk of extinction|statement by hundreds of AI scientists, AI industry leaders, and other public figures demanded that  the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority".

Juergen Schmidhuber, often called a "father of modern AI", did not sign the letter, emphasizing that in 95% of cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier." Schmidhuber added that while AI can be used by bad actors, it "can also be used against the bad actors". Andrew Ng argued that "it’s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests."
