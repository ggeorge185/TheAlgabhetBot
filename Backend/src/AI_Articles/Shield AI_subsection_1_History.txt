Shield AI established in 2015 is a defense and artificial intelligence technology startup founded by former-Navy Seal Officer Brandon Tseng, his brother Ryan Tseng, and Andrew Reiter in San Diego, California. According to David Ignatius, writing for ''The Washington Post'', ex-Navy SEAL Brandon got the startup idea while fighting in Afghanistan. In one of the missions, his unit suffered casualties in the Uruzgan province due to poor reconnaissance of a hostile building. The founding team began operations with a seed fund of $100,000 gathered from friends and family. They began building a prototype of their flagship Nova drone in 2015.

In 2016, Shield AI received its first contract, one from the US Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) autonomy program. As part of this contract, Nova was first deployed for reconnaissance and combat assistance in the Middle East in 2018. It later acquired defense contractor Heron Systems and aerospace company Martin UAV for undisclosed amounts. Over the years, it has received funding from venture capitalist firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Breyer Capital, and Silicon Valley Bank. 

In June 2022, following a $165 million funding round, the company was valued at $2.3 billion.

In 2022, the company received another contract from the US Air Force, through the Pentagon’s AfVentures Strategic Funding Increase (AFWERX-STRATFI) Program. ''FedScoop'' reported the contract to be worth $60 million. In July 2022, it was chosen as one of several companies to aid the US Air Force for its Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) program.

In 2022, the company opened an office in the United Arab Emirates under retired Navy SEAL vice-admiral Bob Harward. The United States Sixth Fleet included the subject in its "Digital Horizon" sea exercise in Bahrain in November 2022 to demonstrate unmanned and artificial intelligence capabilities.

In October 2023, the company raised $200 million at $2.7 billion valuation, co-led by U.S. Innovation Technology Fund (USIT) and Riot Ventures.
