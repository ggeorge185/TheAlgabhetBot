The channel was created in the wake of the success of ''Nothing, Forever'', a Twitch channel that streams an AI-generated sitcom based on ''Seinfeld'' which never ends. ''ai_Sponge'' has also led to a trend on YouTube that consists of using AI-generated voices, primarily of SpongeBob characters, to sing popular songs.

The rise and popularity of artificially generated livestreams has raised several legal questions, including whether ''Nothing, Forever'', ''ai_sponge, ai_Peter,'' and ''The Simulation'' qualify as copyright infringement.
