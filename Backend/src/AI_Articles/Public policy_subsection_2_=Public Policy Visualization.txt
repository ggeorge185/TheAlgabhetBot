A Topology model can be used to demonstrate the types of and implementation of public policy:

The direct section of money explains that a form of direct action is either using the resources already publicly available (Make) or contracting the private sector to address the issue (Buy).

The indirect section of money explains means to dissuade or encourage behavior using money. Literally through taxing the undesired behavior and subsidizing the desired behavior.

The direct section of Other echoes the direct section of Money. However, instead of using fiscal power, the state uses authoritative power to enforce this. This comes in ways of making an action mandatory (Oblige) or prohibiting the behavior by threatening of law (Prohibit).

The indirect section of Other is spreading information on an issue to the public (Inform) and making calls to action on an issue (Implore)

It is through a combined effort of these means that a state addresses and works on any given issue.
