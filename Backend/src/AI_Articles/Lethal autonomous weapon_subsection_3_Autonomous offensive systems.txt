According to ''The Economist'', as technology advances, future applications of unmanned undersea vehicles might include mine clearance, mine-laying, anti-submarine sensor networking in contested waters, patrolling with active sonar, resupplying manned submarines, and becoming low-cost missile platforms. In 2018, the U.S. Nuclear Posture Review alleged that Russia was developing a "new intercontinental, nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo" named "Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System|Status 6".

The Russian Federation is actively developing artificially intelligent missiles, Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones, unmanned vehicles, military robots and medic robots.

Israeli Minister Ayoob Kara stated in 2017 that Israel is developing military robots, including ones as small as flies.

In October 2018, Zeng Yi, a senior executive at the Chinese defense firm Norinco, gave a speech in which he said that "In future battlegrounds, there will be no people fighting", and that the use of lethal autonomous weapons in warfare is "inevitable". In 2019, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper lashed out at China for selling drones capable of taking life with no human oversight.

The British Army deployed new unmanned vehicles and military robots in 2019.

The US Navy is developing "ghost" fleets of unmanned surface vehicle|unmanned ships.

In 2020 a STM Kargu|Kargu 2 drone hunted down and attacked a human target in Libya, according to a report from the UN Security Council's Panel of Experts on Libya, published in March 2021. This may have been the first time an autonomous killer robot armed with lethal weaponry attacked human beings.

In May 2021 Israel conducted an AI guided combat drone swarm attack in Gaza.

Since then there have been numerous reports of swarms and other autonomous weapons systems being used on battlefields around the world.

In addition, DARPA is working on making swarms of 250 autonomous lethal drones available to the American Military.
