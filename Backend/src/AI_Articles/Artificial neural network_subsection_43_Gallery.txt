File:Single layer ann.svg|A single-layer feedforward artificial neural network. Arrows originating from <math>\scriptstyle x_2</math> are omitted for clarity. There are p inputs to this network and q outputs. In this system, the value of the qth output, <math>y_q</math>, is calculated as <math>\scriptstyle y_q = K*(\sum_i(x_i*w_)-b_q).</math>
