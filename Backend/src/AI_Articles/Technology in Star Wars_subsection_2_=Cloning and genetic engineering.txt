''Star Wars'' also depicts the practice of cloning and genetic engineering, though far more advanced and sophisticated than modern scientific and technological standards. Cloning in ''Star Wars'' was first mentioned in the Star Wars (film)|original 1977 ''Star Wars'' film (''A New Hope'') and Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|its novelization. It was first seen on film in ''Star Wars: Episode II â€“ Attack of the Clones'' (2002).

There are major differences between the current ability to clone humans and those seen in ''Star Wars''. Current human cloning methods need to use the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which requires an unfertilized egg from a female donor to have its nucleus removed, resulting in an enucleated egg. DNA from the subject being cloned would need to be extracted and electronically fused together with the enucleated egg. A surrogate mother needs to be impregnated with the embryos to give birth to the clone.

Cloning in ''Star Wars'' does not seem to use this process, and instead depicts advanced machinery that directly processes the human subject's DNA, and produces the clone or clones, by the thousands, if desired. The clones in ''Star Wars'' can also be genetically altered during their pre-birth phase to have their growth hormones and learning abilities accelerated, as well as their independence and self-consciousness restricted.

According to Jeanne Cavelos, a science-fiction writer and former NASA astrophysicist, who is also author of the book ''The Science of Star Wars (book)|The Science of Star Wars'', all of this is a future possibility with the progress of science and technology. What is ''not'' possible, according to her, is the ability to accelerate either the growth of clones, or their ability to learn faster.
