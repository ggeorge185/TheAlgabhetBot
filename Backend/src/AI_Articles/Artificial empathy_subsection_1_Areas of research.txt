There are a variety of philosophical, theoretical, and applicative questions related to artificial empathy. For example:

# Which conditions would have to be met for a robot to respond competently to a human emotion?
# What models of empathy can or should be applied to Social and Assistive Robotics?
# Must the interaction of humans with robots imitate affective interaction between humans?
# Can a robot help science learn about affective development of humans? 
# Would robots create unforeseen categories of inauthentic relations?
# What relations with robots can be considered authentic?
