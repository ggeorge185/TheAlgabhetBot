Games have been a major application of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st century, AIs have produced superhuman results in many games, including Computer chess|chess (IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue), ''Jeopardy!'' (Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson), Go (game)|Go (AlphaGo), poker (Pluribus (poker bot)|Pluribus and Cepheus (poker bot)|Cepheus), Esports|E-sports (StarCraft), and general game playing (AlphaZero and MuZero). AI has replaced hand-coded algorithms in most chess programs. Unlike Go (game)|go or chess, poker is an imperfect information|imperfect-information game, so a program that plays poker has to reason under uncertainty. The general game players work using feedback from the game system, without knowing the rules.
