Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of ''The Hindu'' wrote "Music composer Hesham Abdul Wahab is a big asset to the film. The songs are hummable and pleasant, but the background score takes the cake. When the strains of 'Idhe idhe tholisaarila…' play at different points, it is impossible not to be moved. He also uses the calming notes of the waves and silences where essential." Raghu Bandi of ''The Indian Express'' wrote "Hesham’s music, reminiscent of Kushi tracks, helps the movie immensely." Critic based at''123Telugu'' wrote "Hesham Abdul Wahab’s songs and background score are wonderful. The only downside is the Odiyamma song, which wasn’t absolutely necessary."

Neeshita Nyayapati of ''Hindustan Times'' wrote "The songs might not stay with you, in the sense that you want to listen to them over and over again, but they fit in well with the narrative and sometimes, even add to the scenes." Ram Venkat Srikar of ''Film Companion'' described it as a "soothing and evocative soundtrack". Janani K. of ''India Today'' felt that Wahab shoulders the film, saying "the songs and the background score elevated the film to a greater extent".
