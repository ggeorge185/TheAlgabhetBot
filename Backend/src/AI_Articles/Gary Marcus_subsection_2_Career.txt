In 2015 Marcus co-founded a machine-learning startup, Geometric Intelligence. When Geometric Intelligence was acquired by Uber in December 2016, he became the director of Uber's AI efforts, but left the company in March 2017. 

In 2019 Marcus launched the startup, Robust.AI, with Rodney Brooks, iRobot co-founder and co-inventor of the Roomba. Robust.AI aims to build an "off-the-shelf" machine-learning platform for adoption in autonomous robots, similar to the way video-game engines can be adopted by third-party game developers. 

In his first book, ''The Algebraic Mind'' (2001), Marcus challenged the idea that the mind might consist of largely undifferentiated neural networks. He argued that understanding the mind would require integrating connectionism with classical ideas about symbol-manipulation.

Marcus's book, ''Guitar Zero'' (2012), explores the process of taking up a musical instrument as an adult.

Marcus edited ''The Norton Psychology Reader'' (2005), including selections by cognitive scientists on modern science of the human mind. 

With Jeremy Freeman he co-edited ''The Future of the Brain: Essays by the World's Leading Neuroscientists'' (2014).
