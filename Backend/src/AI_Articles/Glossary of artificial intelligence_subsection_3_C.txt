 (ANN) that can be used to better model hierarchical relationships. The approach is an attempt to more closely mimic biological neural organization.}}






 which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.}}






, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.}}














 --> is a topic that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects.}}


 using a Divide and rule|divide and conquer strategy in which the responses of multiple neural networks (experts) are combined into a single response.  The combined response of the committee machine is supposed to be superior to those of its constituent experts. Compare ensembles of classifiers.}}


 research, commonsense knowledge consists of facts about the everyday world, such as "Lemons are sour", that all humans are expected to know.  The first AI program to address common sense knowledge was Advice Taker in 1959 by John McCarthy.}}

 techniques.}}


 which uses computers in humor research.}}





 devoted to studying the design and analysis of  algorithms.}}








 




 for performing number theory|number theoretic computations.}}






.}}


 systems, steel construction, structural optimization (mathematics)|optimisation, and the invention of novel systems. More recently, traditional CAD simulation is seen to be transformed to CAutoD by biologically inspired , including heuristic search algorithm|search techniques such as evolutionary computation, and  algorithms.}}


''.}}


 that process, store, and communicate digital data|digital information. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.}}





 and , the concept drift means that the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. This causes problems because the predictions become less accurate as time passes.}}


.}}


, a heuristic function is said to be consistent, or monotone, if its estimate is always less than or equal to the estimated distance from any neighboring vertex to the goal, plus the cost of reaching that neighbor.}}


 and inference framework that augments the learning of conditional (probabilistic or discriminative) models with declarative constraints.}}


. In this clause,  is a constraint; <code>A(X,Y)</code>, <code>B(X)</code>, and <code>C(Y)</code> are Literal (mathematical logic)|literals as in regular logic programming. This clause states one condition under which the statement <code>A(X,Y)</code> holds: <code>X+Y</code> is greater than zero and both <code>B(X)</code> and <code>C(Y)</code> are true.}}





 










 and , a genetic operator used to combine the chromosome (genetic algorithm)|genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. It is one way to stochastically generate new candidate solution|solutions from an existing population, and analogous to the chromosomal crossover|crossover that happens during sexual reproduction in biological organisms. Solutions can also be generated by cloning an existing solution, which is analogous to asexual reproduction. Newly generated solutions are typically  before being added to the population.}}
