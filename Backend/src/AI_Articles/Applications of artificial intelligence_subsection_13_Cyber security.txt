Computer security|Cyber security companies are adopting neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing to improve their systems.

Applications of AI in cyber security include:
* Network protection: Machine learning improves intrusion detection systems by broadening the search beyond previously identified threats.
* Endpoint protection: Attacks such as ransomware can be thwarted by learning typical malware behaviors.
* Application security: can help counterattacks such as server-side request forgery, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and Distributed-denial-of-service|distributed denial-of-service.
* Suspect user behavior: Machine learning can identify fraud or compromised applications as they occur.
Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has said that AI will be used to completely automate most cyber security operations over time.
