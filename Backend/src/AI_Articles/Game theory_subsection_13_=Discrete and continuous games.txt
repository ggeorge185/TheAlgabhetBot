Much of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. Continuous games allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, Cournot competition is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.

Continuous games allow the possibility for players to communicate with each other under certain rules, primarily the enforcement of a communication protocol between the players.  By communicating, players have been noted to be willing to provide a larger amount of goods in a public good game than they ordinarily would in a discrete game, and as a result, the players are able to manage resources more efficiently than they would in Discrete games, as they share resources, ideas and strategies with one another.  This incentivises, and causes, continuous games to have a higher median cooperation rate.
