In June 1963, MIT received a $2.2 million grant from the newly created Advanced Research Projects Agency (later known as DARPA). The money was used to fund project MAC which subsumed the "AI Group" founded by Marvin Minsky|Minsky and John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy five years earlier. DARPA continued to provide three million dollars a year until the 70s.
DARPA made similar grants to Allen Newell|Newell and Herbert A. Simon|Simon's program at Carnegie Mellon University|CMU and to the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|Stanford AI Project (founded by John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy in 1963). Another important AI laboratory was established at Edinburgh University by Donald Michie in 1965.
These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research (and funding) in academia for many years.

The money was proffered with few strings attached: J. C. R. Licklider, then the director of DARPA|ARPA, believed that his organization should "fund people, not projects!" and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them. This created a freewheeling atmosphere at MIT that gave birth to the hacker culture, but this "hands off" approach would not last.
