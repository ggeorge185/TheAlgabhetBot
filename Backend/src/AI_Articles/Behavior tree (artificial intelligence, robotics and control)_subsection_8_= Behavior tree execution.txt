The execution of a behavior tree is described by the following standard ordinary difference equations:

<math>x_(t_)=f_i( x_(t_))  </math>

<math>t_=t_+\Delta t </math>

where <math> k\in \mathbb</math> represent the discrete time, and  <math> x \in \mathbb^n  </math> is the state space of the system modelled by the behavior tree.
