During his career, Colby ventured into other, more esoteric areas of research including classifying dreams in "primitive tribes."

Colby was also a chess player, and published a respected chess book called "Secrets of a Grandpatzer."  The book focuses on improving one's Elo rating system|Elo rating from an average level ("patzer") to a very strong level ("grandpatzer", in the range 1700 to 2200).
