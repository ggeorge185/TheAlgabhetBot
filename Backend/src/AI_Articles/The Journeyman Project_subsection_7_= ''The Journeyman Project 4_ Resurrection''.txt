According to IGN in late 1998, "Mindscape confirmed that the rights of ''The Journeyman Project #4'' have been returned to the series' developer, Presto Studios", as a result of financial problems at Red Orb Entertainment. With the closure of Presto Studios in November 2002, there are no plans for more Journeyman Project games to be produced. However, a fourth game design document has been mostly written. The game was originally projected for an October 2000 release and the story "illustrated one of the potentially dangerous outcomes of time travel technology", but the project was eventually put on hold to concentrate on ''Myst III: Exile''.
