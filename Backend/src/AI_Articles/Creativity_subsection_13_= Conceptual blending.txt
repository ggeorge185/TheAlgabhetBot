Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''The Act of Creation'', Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' â€“ that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor, analogy, and structure mapping converged, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art, and humor emerged under the label conceptual blending.
