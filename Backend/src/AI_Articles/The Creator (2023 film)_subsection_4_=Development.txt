Development on the film began in November 2019, when Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards signed to direct and write an untitled science fiction project for New Regency to produce, along with Edwards' ''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' (2016) co-producer Kiri Hart as producer. A test shoot and location scouting was conducted that year, with Edwards using it as the opportunity to envision the film's look: "I took a camera and a 1970s anamorphic lens, we went location-scouting in Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Nepal. Our whole plan was just to go to the greatest locations in the world, because the cost of a flight is way less than the cost of building a set. We were going to hopscotch around the world and shoot this film, then layer in the science-fiction on top afterwards. If our film is trying to achieve something visually, it's trying to feel real in terms of science-fiction."

In February 2020, Edwards was officially announced as director. He cited films such as ''Apocalypse Now'' (1979), ''Baraka (film)|Baraka'' (1992), ''Blade Runner'' (1982), ''Akira (1988 film)|Akira'' (1988), ''Rain Man'' (1988), ''The Hit (1984 film)|The Hit'' (1984), ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (1982) and ''Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon'' (1973) as sources of inspiration.
