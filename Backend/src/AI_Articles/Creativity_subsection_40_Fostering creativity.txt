Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several researchers have proposed methods of increasing a person's creativity. Such ideas range from the Psychology|psychological-cognitive, such as the Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn-Sid Parnes|Parnes Creative problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process, Synectics, science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and Edward de Bono's lateral thinking; to the highly structured, such as TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller), and Computer-Aided Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis.

Daniel H. Pink|Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', argues that we are entering a new age when creativity is increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.

Nickerson provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

An empirical synthesis of which methods work best in enhancing creativity was published by Haase et al. Summarising the results of 84 studies, the authors found that complex training courses, meditation, and cultural exposure were most effective in enhancing creativity, while the use of cognitive manipulation drugs was noneffective.
