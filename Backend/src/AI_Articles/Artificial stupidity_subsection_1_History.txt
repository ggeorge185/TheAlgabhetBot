Alan Turing, in his 1950 paper ''Computing Machinery and Intelligence'', proposed a test for intelligence which has since become known as the Turing test. While there are a number of different versions, the original test, described by Turing as being based on the "imitation game", involved a "machine intelligence" (a computer running an AI program), a female participant, and an interrogator. Both the AI and the female participant were to claim that they were female, and the interrogator's task was to work out which was the female participant and which was not by examining the participant's responses to typed questions. This technique has remained a part of the subsequent Loebner prize competitions, and reflects the issue first raised by Turing.
