In artificial intelligence and cognitive science, the term '''situated''' refers to an Intelligent agent|agent which is embedded systems|embedded in an environment. The term ''situated'' is commonly used to refer to robots, but some researchers argue that software agents can also be situated if:

* they exist in a dynamical system|dynamic (rapidly changing) environment, which
* they can wikt:manipulate|manipulate or change through their actions, and which
* they can sense or Perception|perceive.

Examples might include web-based agents, which can alter data or trigger processes (such as purchases) over the Internet, or virtual-reality bots which inhabit and change virtual worlds, such as Second Life.

Being situated is generally considered to be part of being Embodied embedded cognition|embodied, but it is useful to consider each perspective individually.  The situated perspective emphasizes that intelligent behavior derives from the environment and the agent's interactions with it. The nature of these interactions are defined by an agent's embodiment.
