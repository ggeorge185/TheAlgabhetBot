In the 1960s, Colby began thinking about the ways in which computer theory and application could contribute to the understanding of brain function and mental illness. One early project involved an Intelligent Speech Prosthesis which allowed individuals suffering from aphasia to “speak” by helping them search for and articulate words using whatever phonemic or semantic clues they were able to generate.

Later, Colby would be one of the first to explore the possibilities of computer-assisted psychotherapy.  In 1989, with his son Peter Colby, he formed the company Malibu Artificial Intelligence Works to develop and market a natural language version of cognitive behavioral therapy for Major depressive disorder|depression, called ''Overcoming Depression.'' ''Overcoming Depression'' would go on to be used as a therapeutic learning program by the U.S. Navy and United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veteran Affairs and would be distributed to individuals who used it without supervision from a psychiatrist.  Needless to say, this practice was challenged by the media. To one journalist Colby replied that the program could be better than human therapists because "After all, the computer doesn't burn out, look down on you or try to have sex with you."
