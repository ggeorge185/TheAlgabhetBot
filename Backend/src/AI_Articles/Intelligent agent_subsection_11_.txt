Goal-based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model-based agents, by using "goal" information. Goal information describes situations that are desirable. This provides the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state. Search and automated planning and scheduling|planning are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent's goals.
