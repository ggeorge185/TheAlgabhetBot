A physical neural network or Neuromorphic engineering|Neuromorphic computer  is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a chemical synapse|neural synapse. "Physical" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software-based approaches. More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.
