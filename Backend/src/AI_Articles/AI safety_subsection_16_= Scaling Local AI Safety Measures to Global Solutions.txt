In addressing the AI safety problem it is important to stress the distinction between local and global solutions. Local solutions focus on individual AI systems, ensuring they are safe and beneficial, while global solutions seek to implement safety measures for all AI systems across various jurisdictions. Some researchers argue for the necessity of scaling local safety measures to a global level, proposing a classification for these global solutions. This approach underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in the international governance of AI safety, emphasizing that no single entity can effectively manage the risks associated with AI technologies. This perspective aligns with ongoing efforts in international policy-making and regulatory frameworks, which aim to address the complex challenges posed by advanced AI systems worldwide.
