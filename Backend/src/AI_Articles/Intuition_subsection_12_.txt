In Islam various scholars have varied interpretations of intuition (often termed as , Arabic: , "hitting correctly on a mark"), sometimes relating the ability to have intuitive knowledge to prophethood. 
Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi, in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (), from following influences of Plato, finds that intuition is knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature; he also suggests mystical contemplation () to bring about correct judgment. Also influenced by Platonic ideas, Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) finds the ability to have intuition is a "prophetic capacity" and he describes intuition as knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge is based on intellectual certitude.
