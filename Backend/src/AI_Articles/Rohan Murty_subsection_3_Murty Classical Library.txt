Although he does not read Sanskrit, when Murty was a doctoral student of computer science at Harvard, he took a class focusing on Kumarila Bhatta's ''Shlokavartika'', which got him interested in ancient Indian philosophy and sciences.

He is the founder of the Murty Classical Library of India, a continuation of the Clay Sanskrit Library Project headed by Sheldon Pollock. In 2016, he rejected a petition asking that Pollock be removed from the position of chief editor of the Murty Classical Library.
