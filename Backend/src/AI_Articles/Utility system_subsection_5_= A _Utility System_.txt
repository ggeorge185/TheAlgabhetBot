While the work of Richard Evans, and subsequent AI programmers on the Sims franchise such as David "Rez" Graham were heavily based on utility AI, Dave Mark and his co-worker from ArenaNet, Mike Lewis, went on to lecture at the AI Summit during the 2015 GDC about a full stand-alone architecture he had developed, the Infinite Axis Utility System (IAUS). The IAUS was designed to be a data-driven, self-contained architecture that, once hooked up to the inputs and outputs of the game system, did not require much programming support. In a way, this made it similar to behavior trees and planners where the reasoner (what makes the decisions) was fully established and it was left to the development team to add behaviors into the mix as they saw fit.
