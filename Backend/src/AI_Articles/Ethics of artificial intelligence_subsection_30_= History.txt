Historically speaking, the investigation of moral and ethical implications of "thinking machines" goes back at least to the Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz already poses the question if we might attribute intelligence to a mechanism that behaves as if it were a sentient being, and so does René Descartes|Descartes, who describes what could be considered an early version of the Turing test.

The Romanticism|romantic period has several times envisioned artificial creatures that escape the control of their creator with dire consequences, most famously in Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein''. The widespread preoccupation with industrialization and mechanization in the 19th and early 20th century, however, brought ethical implications of unhinged technical developments to the forefront of fiction: R.U.R.|''R.U.R – Rossum's Universal Robots'', Karel Čapek's play of sentient robots endowed with emotions used as slave labor is not only credited with the invention of the term 'robot' (derived from the Czech word for forced labor, ''robota'') but was also an international success after it premiered in 1921. George Bernard Shaw's play ''Back to Methuselah'', published in 1921, questions at one point the validity of thinking machines that act like humans; Fritz Lang's 1927 film ''Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis'' shows an Android (robot)|android leading the uprising of the exploited masses against the oppressive regime of a Technocracy|technocratic society.
