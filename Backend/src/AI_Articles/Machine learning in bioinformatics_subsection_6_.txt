Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a class of deep neural network whose architecture is based on shared weights of convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features, providing translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. CNNs take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble patterns of increasing complexity using smaller and simpler patterns discovered via their filters.

Convolutional networks were mathematical biology|inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between Artificial neuron|neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.

CNN uses relatively little pre-processing compared to other Image classification|image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns to optimize the Filter (signal processing)|filters (or kernels) through automated learning, whereas in traditional algorithms these filters are Feature engineering|hand-engineered. This reduced reliance on prior knowledge of the analyst and on human intervention in manual feature extraction makes CNNs a desirable model. In this approach, phylogenetic data is endowed with patristic distance (the sum of the lengths of all branches connecting two operational taxonomic units [OTU]) to select k-neighborhoods for each OTU, and each OTU and its neighbors are processed with convolutional filters.
