Outline of software engineering
* Formal methods – Mathematical approaches for describing and reasoning about software design.
* Software engineering – The principles and practice of designing, developing, and testing programs, as well as proper engineering practices.
*  Algorithm design – Using ideas from algorithm theory to creatively design solutions to real tasks.
*  Computer programming – The practice of using a programming language to implement algorithms.
*  Human–computer interaction – The study and design of computer interfaces that people use.
* Reverse engineering – The application of the scientific method to the understanding of arbitrary existing software.
