File:Nietzsche_-_Ainsi_parlait_Zarathoustra.djvu|thumb|The philosopher behind the belief of superhumanism believed in the importance of creating a greater meaning in life through individual betterment.
The ''Übermensch'' or "Superman" was postulated in the later writings of Friedrich Nietzsche as a type of supreme, ultra-aristocracy|aristocratic achievement which becomes possible in the transcendence of modernity, morals or nihilism. Nietzsche believed in creating the perfect human, or at least a definition of one, and achieving this perfection through the enhancement of individual and cultural health, creativity, and power, and that to be a successful human one would focus on the realities of our world, rather than the beyond world, or afterlife.

Nietzsche explores the idea of a superhuman in his work ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', in which he discusses the reality of humans existing as just that, and their potential to be more, through risks taken to advance humanity. This belief focuses not on a man who is bettering oneself but instead establishes values which create a meaning to life greater than one person, and positively influencing the lives of others with an overarching goal of humanity. These goals help one overcome life's feeling of meaninglessness.
