Family members have aspects of environments in common (for example, characteristics of the home). This shared family environment accounts for 0.25â€“0.35 of the variation in IQ in childhood. By late adolescence, it is quite low (zero in some studies). The effect for several other psychological traits is similar. These studies have not looked at the effects of extreme environments, such as in abusive families.}}
