In 2013, the company began using artificial intelligence to screen interviewees. Both proprietary voice recognition software and licensed facial recognition software are used by HireVue's Insights program. All of these analyzed data points are then used to generate an "employability" score for a candidate, which is ranked versus other applicants.

By 2017, Kevin Parker was the company's CEO. While the company maintained no bias resulted from its use of such technology, Parker conceded it "wasn't worth the concern" to keep. In October, HireVue acquired AllyO, a chatbot technology startup.

In 2022, Anthony Reynolds succeeded Parker as the company's CEO. In May 2023, HireVue acquired one of its competitors, Modern Hire.
