Design justice in artificial intelligence aims to transform the design process of artificial intelligence products. Currently, the design of artificial intelligence is inequitable because of who has power in the design process, who the users of the technology are imagined to be, and where the design is taking place. Design Justice in artificial intelligence aims to bridge the gap between the two groups and deconstruct the power dynamic in the artificial intelligence design process. A specific case would be in resume screenings. Artificial intelligence has been used in resume screenings to automate and speed the process of resume screenings, helping employers find candidates faster, making sure qualified candidates are notified and making the hiring process smoother on both sides. However, if the resume dataset contains past biases in the company, these biases will continue to be reflected by the artificial intelligence resume screening. Amazon (company)|Amazon had used a machine learning resume tool until machine learning specialists found that the tool was discriminating against women because the models were trained on resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period, mostly coming from men. Design justice could be used in this context to evaluate the dataset and make sure it adheres with Amazonâ€™s goals to have a diverse workforce.
