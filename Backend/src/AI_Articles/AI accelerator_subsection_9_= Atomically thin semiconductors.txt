In 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). Such atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient machine learning applications, where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage. The authors used two-dimensional materials such as semiconducting molybdenum disulfide. The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs, and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds.
as the collective noun for "graphics accelerators", which had taken many forms before settling on an overall graphics pipeline|pipeline implementing a model presented by Direct3D.

All models of Intel Meteor Lake processors have a ''Versatile Processor Unit'' (''VPU'') built-in for accelerating statistical inference|inference for computer vision and deep learning.
