Main|Intelligent agent#Objective function}}
In the ''Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA'' paradigm, programmers provide an AI such as AlphaZero with an "objective function" that the programmers intend to encapsulate the goal or goals the programmers want the AI to accomplish. Such an AI later populates a (possibly implicit) internal "model" of its environment. This model encapsulates all the agent's beliefs about the world. The AI then creates and executes whatever plan is calculated to maximize the value of its objective function. For example, AlphaZero chess has a simple objective function of "+1 if AlphaZero wins, -1 if AlphaZero loses". During the game, AlphaZero attempts to execute whatever sequence of moves it judges most likely to attain the maximum value of +1. Similarly, a reinforcement learning system can have a "reward function" that allows the programmers to shape the AI's desired behavior. An evolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a "fitness function".
