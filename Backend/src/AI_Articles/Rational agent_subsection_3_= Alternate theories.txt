Neuroeconomics is a concept that uses neuroscience, social psychology and other fields of science to better understand how people make decisions.  Unlike rational agent theory, neuroeconomics does not attempt to predict large-scale human behavior but rather how individuals make decisions in case-by-case scenarios.
