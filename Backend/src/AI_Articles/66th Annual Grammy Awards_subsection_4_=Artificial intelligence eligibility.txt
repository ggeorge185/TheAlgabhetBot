On June 16, 2023, in response to the rapidly developing field of Music and artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence, the Recording Academy declared that "only human creators are eligible to be submitted for consideration for, nominated for, or win a Grammy Award. A work that contains no human authorship is not eligible in any categories." The academy further specified that works featuring AI-generated material are eligible for an award only if a human contributed to the work meaningfully in the creation process, and that contributors of only AI-generated material are not eligible for an award.
