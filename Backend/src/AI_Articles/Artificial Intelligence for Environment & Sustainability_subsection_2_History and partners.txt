The ARIES Project started in April 2007 at the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics of the University of Vermont, United States, sponsored by a $1M grant from the U.S. government's National Science Foundation. A prototype of the model building system was developed over the following year, and a functional prototype was made available online in 2012. Since 2010, the project has been based at BC3, where the technology has continued developing ever since. Since 2013, the ARIES team has held the International Spring University (ISU) on Ecosystem Services Modelling, an annual intensive modelling school for scientists and policy analysts working in the environmental sustainability field.

ARIES is led from a global hub at BC3 in collaboration with Ca' Foscari University of Venice, the Global Change Research Centre, HydroloGIS Environmental Engineering, IHCantabria, the Institute of Materials and Systems for Sustainability of Nagoya University, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), UN DESA, the University of Udine, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
