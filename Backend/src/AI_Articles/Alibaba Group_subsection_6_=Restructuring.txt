In March 2023, Alibaba announced their "1+6+N" restructuring plan, which reorganized its business structure into six independently run entities: Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao and Tmall Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network, Local Services group, Alibaba International Digital Commerce, and the Digital Media and Entertainment group. Each business unit would have their own CEO and board of directors and be able to seek their own fundraising and market listings. Under the new "1+6+N" structure, Alibaba also established a Capital Management Committee and a Compliance and Risk Committee. ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported on 30 March that Jack Ma engineered this in talks with company CEO Daniel Zhang while he was overseas.

In September 2023, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Ltd., the logistics arm of Alibaba Group, has filed for its Hong Kong initial public offering, potentially making it among the first of the Chinese e-commerce leader's units to go public.
