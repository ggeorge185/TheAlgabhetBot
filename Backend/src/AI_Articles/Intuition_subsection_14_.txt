In his book ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', René Descartes|Descartes refers to an "intuition" (from the Latin verb , which means "to see") as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition states that "whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive to be true is true"; this is commonly referred to as logical intuition|rational intuition It is a component of a potential logical mistake called the Cartesian circle. Intuition and Natural deduction#Judgments and propositions|deduction, says Descartes, are the unique possible sources of knowledge of the human intellect; the latter is a "connected sequence of intuitions", each of which is ''a priori'' a self-evidence|self-evident, clear and distinct idea, before it is connected with the other ideas within a logical demonstration.

David Hume|Hume has a more ambiguous interpretation of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation). He states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind"—attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of empiricism.
