An article by Jiang, et al. (2017) demonstrated that there are several types of AI techniques that have been used for a variety of different diseases, such as support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees. Each of these techniques is described as having a "training goal" so "classifications agree with the outcomes as much as possibleâ€¦".

To demonstrate some specifics for disease diagnosis/classification there are two different techniques used in the classification of these diseases including using Artificial neural network|artificial neural networks (ANN) and Bayesian networks (BN). It was found that ANN was better and could more accurately classify diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Through the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), artificial intelligence has been able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the manipulation of mass electronic health records (EHR's). Medical conditions have grown more complex, and with a vast history of electronic medical records building, the likelihood of case duplication is high. but also factor in chief symptoms and help the physicians ask the most appropriate questions helps the patient receive the most accurate diagnosis and treatment possible. Combining the skills of medical professionals and machines can help overcome decision-making weaknesses in medical practice. To do so, one needs precise disease definitions and a probabilistic analysis of symptoms and molecular profiles. Physicists have been studying similar problems for years, using microscopic elements and their interactions to extract macroscopic states of various physical systems. Physics inspired machine learning approaches can thus be applied to study disease processes and to perform biomarker analysis.
