Original research|section|date=February 2023|discuss=Talk:Intelligent agent#As a definition of artificial intelligence}}
Philosophically, this definition of artificial intelligence avoids several lines of criticism. Unlike the Turing test, it does not refer to human intelligence in any way. Thus, there is no need to discuss if it is "real" vs "simulated" intelligence (i.e., synthetic intelligence|"synthetic" vs "artificial" intelligence) and does not indicate that such a machine has a mind, consciousness or true intentionality|understanding (i.e., it does not imply John Searle's "Chinese room#Strong AI|strong AI hypothesis"). It also doesn't attempt to draw a sharp dividing line between behaviors that are "intelligent" and behaviors that are "unintelligent"—programs need only be measured in terms of their objective function.

More importantly, it has a number of practical advantages that have helped move AI research forward. It provides a reliable and scientific way to test programs; researchers can directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given "goal function".  It also gives them a common language to communicate with other fields—such as mathematical optimization (which is defined in terms of "goals") or economics (which uses the same definition of a "rational agent").
