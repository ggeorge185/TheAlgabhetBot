Main|g Factor in Non-Humans}}

Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non-human animals. The general factor of intelligence, or g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor, is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual's scores on a wide range of Cognitive skill|cognitive abilities. First described in humans, the ''g'' factor has since been identified in a number of non-human species.

Cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same, largely verbally dependent, scales developed for humans. Instead, intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation, habit reversal, social learning theory|social learning, and responses to novelty. Studies have shown that ''g'' is responsible for 47% of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates
