Self-awareness", as noted above, is sometimes used by science fiction writers as a name for the essentialism|essential human property that makes a character fully human. Alan Turing|Turing strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to "can a machine be the subject of its own thought?" Can it ''think about itself''? Viewed in this way, a program can be written that can report on its own internal states, such as a debugger. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways. It must be possible, even trivial, for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways. (Douglas Lenat's Automated Mathematician, as one example, combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths.) Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan and Haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity, while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned.

In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings. Also in 2009, researchers at Cornell developed Eureqa, a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted, such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulum's motion.
