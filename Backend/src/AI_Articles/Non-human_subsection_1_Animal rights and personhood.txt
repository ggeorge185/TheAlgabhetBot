Further information|Personhood#Non-human animals}}
In the animal rights movement, it is common to distinguish between "Personhood#Humans|human animals" and "non-human animals". Participants in the animal rights movement generally recognize that non-human animals have some similar characteristics to those of human personhood|persons. For example, various non-human animals have been shown to register pain, compassion, memory, and some Animal cognition|cognitive function.  Some animal rights activists argue that the similarities between human and non-human animals justify giving non-human animals rights that human society has afforded to humans, such as the right to self-preservation, and some even wish for all non-human animals or at least those that bear a fully thinking and conscious mind, such as vertebrates and some invertebrates such as cephalopods, to be given a full right of personhood.
