Among the critics of John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy's approach were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like "story understanding" and "object recognition" that ''required'' a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like "chair" or "restaurant" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that "using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise." Roger Schank|Schank described their "anti-logic" approaches as "Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy", as opposed to the "Neats vs. scruffies|neat" paradigms used by John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy, Robert Kowalski|Kowalski, Edward Feigenbaum|Feigenbaum, Allen Newell|Newell and Herbert A. Simon|Simon.

In 1975, in a seminal paper, Marvin Minsky|Minsky noted that many of his fellow researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our commonsense knowledge|common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be "logical", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the ''context'' of everything we say and think. He called these structures "Frame (Artificial intelligence)|frames". Roger Schank|Schank used a version of frames he called "Scripts (artificial intelligence)|scripts" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.
