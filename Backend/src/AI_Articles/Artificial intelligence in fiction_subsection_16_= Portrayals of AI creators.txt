Scholars have noted that fictional creators of AI are overwhelmingly male: in the 142 most influential films featuring AI from 1920 to 2020, only 9 of 116 AI creators portrayed (8%) were female. Such creators are portrayed as lone geniuses (eg, Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark in the Iron Man films), associated with the military (eg, ''Colossus: The Forbin Project'') and large corporations (eg, ''I, Robot (film)|I, Robot''), or making human-like AI to replace a lost loved one or serve as the ideal lover<!--this is the Pygmalion myth, scholars must have noted that too, at length--> (eg, ''The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives'').<ref name="Cave Dihal Drage McInerney 2023"/>
