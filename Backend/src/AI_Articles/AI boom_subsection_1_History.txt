In 2012, a University of Toronto research team used artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques to lower their error rate below 25% for the first time during the ImageNet challenge for object recognition in computer vision. The event catalyzed the AI boom later in that decade, when alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. The Generative artificial intelligence|generative AI race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphical processing unit, the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial network, diffusion model and Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer architecture. In 2018, the Artificial Intelligence Index, an initiative from Stanford University, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and better drug development. Economic researchers and lawmakers began to discuss the impact of AI more frequently. By 2022, large language models saw increased usage in chatbot applications; Text-to-image model|text-to-image-models could generate images that appeared to be human-made; and speech synthesis software was able to replicate human speech efficiently.

According to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, the number of startups, and patents granted in AI. Scientists that have Immigration to the United States|immigrated to the U.S. play an outsize role in the country's development of AI technology. Many of them were educated in China, prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries. A Council on Foreign Relations analyst outlined ways that the U.S. could maintain its position amid progress made by China. In 2023  an analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies advocated that the U.S. use its dominance in AI technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on Trade globalization|trade agreements.

AlphaFold 2 score of more than 90 in CASP's Global distance test|global distance test (GDT) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology. Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize winner and Structural biology|structural biologist Venki Ramakrishnan called the result "a stunning advance on the protein folding problem", AlphaFold 2's success received widespread media attention.  

The ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to have a wide variety of benefits in the life sciences space including accelerating advanced drug discovery and enabling better understanding of diseases. Writing about the event, the ''MIT Technology Review'' noted that the AI had "solved a fifty-year old grand challenge of biology." It went on to note that the AI algorithm could "predict the shape of proteins to within the width of an atom." An upgraded version called GPT-3.5 was used in ChatGPT, which later garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. A new version called GPT-4 was released on March 14, 2023, and was used in the Microsoft Bing search engine. Other language models have been released such as PaLM and Gemini (language model)|Gemini by Google and LLaMA by Meta Platforms.

In January 2023, DeepL Write, an AI-based tool to improve monolingual texts, was released. In December 2023, Gemini (language model)|Gemini, the latest model by Google, was unveiled, claiming to beat previous state-of-the-art-model GPT-4 on most benchmarks.
