, kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support vector machine (SVM). The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example Cluster analysis|clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, Statistical classification|classifications) in datasets.}}

 dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks such as Computer-aided diagnosis|diagnosing a medical condition or natural language user interface|having a dialog in a natural language. Knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge in order to design Formalism (mathematics)|formalisms that will make complex systems easier to design and build.  Knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from logic to automate various kinds of ''reasoning'', such as the application of rules or the relations of Set theory|sets and subsets. Examples of knowledge representation formalisms include Semantic network|semantic nets, systems architecture, Frame (artificial intelligence)|frames, rules, and Ontology (information science)|ontologies. Examples of automated reasoning engines include inference engines, automated theorem proving|theorem provers, and classifiers.}}
