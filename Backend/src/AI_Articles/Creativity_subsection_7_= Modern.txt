The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas and Max Wertheimer. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of five stages:
# ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
# ''Incubation (psychology)|incubation'' (in which the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
# ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
# ''illumination'' or insight (in which the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness);
# ''verification'' (in which the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is also often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''Process and Reality''. He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts... a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".

Although psychometric studies of creativity had been conducted by The London School of Psychology as early as 1927 with the work of H.L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, the formal Psychometrics|psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox Psychology|psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J.P. Guilford's address to the American Psychological Association in 1950. The address helped to popularize the study of creativity and to focus attention on scientific approaches to conceptualizing creativity. Statistical analyzes led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition from Intelligence quotient|IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.
