The removal reportedly left OpenAI in "chaos", according to ''The New York Times''. According to Bloomberg News, a significant number of OpenAI engineers threatened to resign if the board did not reconsider Altman's removal.

According to ''The Information'', Altman's removal risked a share sale led by Thrive Capital valuing the company at  billion. A potential second tender offer for early-stage investors was also at risk. ''The Information'' later reported that Thrive Capital's tender offer will continue after Altman's reinstatement.

OpenAI delayed the release of its online chatbot store as a result of Altman's removal.
