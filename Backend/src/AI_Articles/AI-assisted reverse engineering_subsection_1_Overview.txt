Conventionally, reverse engineering is conducted by specialists who dismantle a system to grasp its working principles, often for the purposes of reproduction, modification, enhancement of compatibility, or forensic examination. This method, while efficient, can be laborious and time-intensive, particularly when dealing with intricate software or hardware systems.

AIARE integrates machine learning algorithms to either partially automate or augment this process. It is capable of detecting patterns, relationships, structures, and potential vulnerabilities within the analyzed system, frequently surpassing human experts in speed and accuracy. This has rendered AIARE a critical tool in numerous fields, including cybersecurity, software development, and hardware design and analysis.
