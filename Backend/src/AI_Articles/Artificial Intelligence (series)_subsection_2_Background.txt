When asked about the series in a 2016 interview with online electronic music journal Resident Advisor, Sean Booth of Autechre said that,<blockquote>I dunno, I didn't come up with Artificial Intelligence. You'd have to ask [Warp founder] Rob Mitchell and he's not around any more! I think it was a joke, really. There was a definite tongue-in-cheek thing going on with the AI series initially, everyone knew it was a bit silly. But we were enjoying doing it. Thing is, almost all the artists on that first AI compilation are just like us, they were regular kids, they're not intelligent people particularly. Aphex Twin|Richard [D. James] is a fucking blagger, Richie Hawtin too... I don't know how the fuck he gets away with the things he does! Alex Paterson, people like that, they're not known for being intellectually powerful, they're just fucking good musicians.</blockquote>

Each of the albums was released on Vinyl record|vinyl, compact cassette|cassette and Compact disc|CD; each of the artist albums was also released on limited edition coloured or transparent vinyl.  The video release ''Motion'', released on VHS (and Laserdisc in Japan), mostly contained tracks from ''Artificial Intelligence II''.
