In March 2023, an anonymous construction worker from Chicago used Midjourney to create a fake image of Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga puffer jacket. The image went viral, receiving over twenty million views. Writer Ryan Broderick dubbed it "the first real mass-level AI misinformation case". Experts consulted by ''Slate (magazine)|Slate'' characterized the image as unsophisticated: "you could have made it on Photoshop five years ago".
