Yang, Hausladen, Peters, Pournaras, Fricker and Helbing present an empirical study of explainability in participatory budgeting. They compared the Greedy and the Method of Equal Shares|Equal Shares rules, and three types of explanations: ''mechanism explanation'' (a general explanation of how the aggregation rule works given the voting input), ''individual explanation'' (explaining how many voters had at least one approved project, at least 10000 CHF in approved projects), and ''group explanation'' (explaining how the budget is distributed among the districts and topics). They compared the perceived ''trustworthyness'' and ''fairness'' of Greedy and Equal Shares, before and after the explanations. They found out that, for MES, Mechanism explanation yields the highest increase in perceived fairness and trustworthiness; the second-highest was Group explanation. For Greedy, Mechanims explanation increases perceived trustworthiness but not fairness, whereas Individual explanation increases both perceived fairness and trustworthiness. Group explanation ''decreases'' the perceived fairness and trustworthiness.
