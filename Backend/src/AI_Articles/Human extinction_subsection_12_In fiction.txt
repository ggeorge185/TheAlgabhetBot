Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville's 1805 science fantasy novel ''Le dernier homme'' (''The Last Man''), which depicts human extinction due to infertility, is considered the first modern apocalyptic novel and credited with launching the genre. Other notable early works include Mary Shelley's 1826 ''The Last Man (Mary Shelley novel)|The Last Man'', depicting human extinction caused by a pandemic, and Olaf Stapledon's 1937 ''Star Maker'', "a comparative study of omnicide".

Some 21st century pop-science works, including ''The World Without Us'' by Alan Weisman, and the television specials ''Life After People'' and ''Aftermath: Population Zero'' pose a thought experiment: what would happen to the rest of the planet if humans suddenly disappeared? A threat of human extinction, such as through a technological singularity (also called an intelligence explosion), drives the plot of innumerable science fiction stories; an influential early example is the 1951 film adaption of ''When Worlds Collide''. Usually the extinction threat is narrowly avoided, but some exceptions exist, such as ''R.U.R.'' and Steven Spielberg's ''A.I. Artificial Intelligence|A.I.''
