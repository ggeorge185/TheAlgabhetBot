Change detection (GIS)|Change detection is an image analysis problem, consisting of the identification of places where the land cover has changed over time. Change detection (GIS)|Change detection is widely used in fields such as urban growth, Forest dynamics|forest and vegetation dynamics, land use and Disaster Monitoring Constellation|disaster monitoring.
The earliest applications of ensemble classifiers in change detection are designed with the majority plurality voting|voting, Bayesian model averaging, and the maximum posterior probability. Given the growth of satellite data over time, the past decade sees more use of time series methods for continuous change detection from image stacks. One example is a Bayesian ensemble changepoint detection method called BEAST, with the software available as a package Rbeast in R, Python, and Matlab.
