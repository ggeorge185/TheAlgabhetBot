Following the events of ''Network Effect'', a Barish-Estranza explorer, accompanied by their own SecUnits, arrives and engages in skirmishes with Murderbot, ART's crew, and the humans from Preservation. They independently discover a separatist group of colonists. This prompts them to take action to protect corporate interests and colonist freedoms, respectively.

Murderbot establishes a connection with the newly discovered colony's legacy computer system. The Murderbot crew maneuvers for diplomatic advantage with the colonists, and they organize a media event to influence public opinion. We later learn the Barish-Estranza group is led by Supervisor Leonide, whom we last encountered in ‘’Network Effect’’. Tactical conflicts unfold, and it becomes apparent that Leonide faces internal dissent within the Barish-Estranza group, leading to an assassination attempt. From that point on she assists the Murderbot crew.

Throughout the narrative, Murderbot grapples with a distracting event marked as <redacted>, affecting its performance, particularly in its internal narration. We learn that since the events of ''Network Effect'', Murderbot experienced the construct equivalents of panic attacks and hallucinations, and recognizes the need for trauma recovery treatment.

Confronted with the information gathered by the Murderbot crew, Barish-Estranza is compelled to abandon their claims to the planet. Preservation negotiates for study rights concerning the alien artifacts, and ongoing discussions between the colonist factions ensue. Murderbot decides to continue traveling with ART.
