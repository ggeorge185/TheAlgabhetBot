Newell and Simon formed a lasting partnership. They founded an artificial intelligence laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University and produced a series of important programs and theoretical insights throughout the late fifties and sixties. This work included the General Problem Solver, a highly influential implementation of meansâ€“ends analysis, and the physical symbol systems hypothesis, the controversial philosophical assertion that all intelligent behavior could be reduced to the kind of symbol manipulation that Newell's programs demonstrated.

Newell's work culminated in the development of a cognitive architecture known as Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar and his unified theory of cognition, published in 1990, but their improvement was the objective of his efforts up to his death ([http://erg4146.casaccia.enea.it/Newell-L.htm one of the last Newell's letters] ). The field of cognitive architectures, that he initiated, is still active in both the artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science communities.
