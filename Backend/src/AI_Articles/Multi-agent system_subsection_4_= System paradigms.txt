Many MAS are implemented in computer simulations, stepping the system through discrete "time steps". The MAS components communicate typically using a weighted request matrix, e.g. 
  Speed-VERY_IMPORTANT: min=45&nbsp;mph, 
  Path length-MEDIUM_IMPORTANCE: max=60 expectedMax=40, 
  Max-Weight-UNIMPORTANT 
  Contract Priority-REGULAR 
and a weighted response matrix, e.g. 
  Speed-min:50 but only if weather sunny, 
  Path length:25 for sunny / 46 for rainy
  Contract Priority-REGULAR
  note â€“ ambulance will override this priority and you'll have to wait

A challenge-response-contract scheme is common in MAS systems, where 
* First a '''"'''Who can?'''"''' question is distributed.
* Only the relevant components respond: '''"'''I can, at this price'''"'''.
* Finally, a contract is set up, usually in several short communication steps between sides, 
also considering other components, evolving "contracts" and the restriction sets of the component algorithms.

Another paradigm commonly used with MAS is the "pheromone", where components leave information for other nearby components. These pheromones may evaporate/concentrate with time, that is their values may decrease (or increase).
