Kasparov initially called Deep Blue an "alien opponent" but later belittled it, stating that it was "as intelligent as your alarm clock". According to Martin Amis, two grandmasters who played Deep Blue agreed that it was "like a wall coming at you". Hsu had the rights to use the Deep Blue design independently of IBM, but also independently declined Kasparov's rematch offer. In 2003, the documentary film ''Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine'' investigated Kasparov's claims that IBM had cheated. In the film, some interviewees describe IBM's investment in Deep Blue as an effort to boost its stock value.
