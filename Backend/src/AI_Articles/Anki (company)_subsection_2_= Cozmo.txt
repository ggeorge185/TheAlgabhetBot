In October 2016, Anki launched Cozmo in the US. Cozmo is a robot about 4 inches by 3 by 2 inches. It is mostly white, with red details, and gray on the end of its robot arm. There is a light on top of its body, with a gray border, which can shine different colors. A "collector's edition" Cozmo was released in 2017, with a "Liquid Metal" smoked gray chrome finish. A "limited edition" Cozmo, with an "Interstellar Blue" blue, white, and gray finish, was released in 2018.<ref name=":0" />

Cozmo comes with three illuminated cubes it communicates with in order to play games and can autonomously move, lift and roll the cubes, and the cubes are powered by LR1, N, AM5, E90, batteries for power.
Production of Cozmo ceased in May 2019 when Anki shutdown due to lack of funding.
