The areas in which evolutionary algorithms are practically used are almost unlimited engineering, complex scheduling, agriculture, robot movement planning and finance to research and Evolutionary art|art. The application of an evolutionary algorithm requires some rethinking from the inexperienced user, as the approach to a task using an EA is different from conventional exact methods and this is usually not part of the curriculum of engineers or other disciplines. For example, the fitness calculation must not only formulate the goal but also support the evolutionary search process towards it, e.g. by rewarding improvements that do not yet lead to a better evaluation of the original quality criteria. For example, if peak utilisation of resources such as personnel deployment or energy consumption is to be avoided in a scheduling task, it is not sufficient to assess the maximum utilisation. Rather, the number and duration of exceedances of a still acceptable level should also be recorded in order to reward reductions below the actual maximum peak value. There are therefore some publications that are aimed at the beginner and want to help avoiding beginner's mistakes as well as leading an application project to success. This includes clarifying the fundamental question of when an EA should be used to solve a problem and when it is better not to.
