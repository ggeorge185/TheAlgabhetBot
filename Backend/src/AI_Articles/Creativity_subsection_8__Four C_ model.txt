James C. Kaufman and Ronald A. Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity. The four "C's" are the following: 

# ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights").
# ''little-c'' (everyday problem-solving and creative expression).
# ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent).
# ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field).

This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component of, and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto, and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defined creativity in terms of individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton analyzed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.
