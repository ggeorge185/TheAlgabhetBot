There are several broad aspects of AI that may give rise to specific hazards.  The risks depend on implementation rather than the mere presence of AI.

The use of AI also increases Computer security|cybersecurity risks relative to platforms that do not use AI,  Many hazards of AI are psychosocial in nature due to its potential to cause changes in work organization, in terms of increasing complexity and interaction between different organizational factors.  However, psychosocial risks are often overlooked by designers of advanced manufacturing systems.
