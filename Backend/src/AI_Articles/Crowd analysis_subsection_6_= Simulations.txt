A system can generate a '''realistic crowd simulation''' with given inputs and simulate how the simulated moving objects, or agents, will interact with each other and with the environment. The goal is to replicate a crowd's movement patterns given numerous agents in a given space. Algorithms based on crowd analysis attempt to manage the movement of the crowd. The more efficient and realistic a simulation becomes, the more complex the algorithm must become. The software must be able to manipulate the trajectory of individual agents based on variables such as the agents' goals, stress (mechanics)|stress forces, obstacles, and Yerkesâ€“Dodson law#Levels of arousal|levels of arousal.
