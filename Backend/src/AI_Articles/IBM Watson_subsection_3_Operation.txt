Watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases. The more algorithms that find the same answer independently, the more likely Watson is to be correct. Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions, it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. After signaling, Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in ''Jeopardy!'' question format.

The ''Jeopardy!'' staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz, Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds. The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light, To compete successfully on ''Jeopardy!'', Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve. ''InformationWeek'' described Kelly as "the father of Watson" and credited him for encouraging the system to compete against humans on ''Jeopardy!''. By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with ''Jeopardy!'' champions.

During the game, Watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage but was not connected to the Internet. as well as students from New York Medical College. Among the team of IBM programmers who worked on Watson was 2001 ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' top prize winner Ed Toutant, who himself had appeared on ''Jeopardy!'' in 1989 (winning one game).
