A very important use of AIOps platforms is related to the analysis of large and unconnected datasets, such as the Johns Hopkins Covid-19's data published through GitHub. The data in this example is pulled from a large number of unnormalized form|un-normalized databases  - aggregated data (10 sources), US regional data (113 sources) and Non-US data (37 sources), which are unuseable considering the needed emergency response time by the traditional analysis models.

Generally, the main areas of use for AIOps platforms and principles are
* Automation of tasks (DevOps)
* Machine learning platforms
* Augmented reality
* Agent-based model|Agent-based simulations
* Internet of things (IoT)
* AI Optimized Hardware
* Natural language generation
* Streaming data platforms
* Conversational business intelligence|BI and analytics
