Workers have been primarily located in the United States since the platform's inception with demographics generally similar to the overall Internet population in the U.S. Within the U.S. workers are fairly evenly spread across states, proportional to each stateâ€™s share of the U.S. population. , between 15 and 30 thousand people in the U.S. complete at least one HIT each month and about 4,500 new people join MTurk each month.

Cash payments for Indian workers were introduced in 2010, which updated the demographics of workers, who however remained primarily within the United States. A website showing worker demographics in May 2015 showed that 80% of workers were located in the United States, with the remaining 20% located elsewhere in the world, most of whom were in India. In May 2019, approximately 60% were in the U.S., 40% elsewhere (approximately 30% in India). In early 2023 about 90% of workers were from the U.S. and about half of the remainder from India.
