HireVue's service has received some criticism from interview candidates and AI researchers, particularly for its analysis of "micro-expressions". Commentary on its perceived drawbacks and potential to incite anxiety in interviewees has also been made. In 2015, ''Fortune (magazine)|Fortune'' writer Katherine Reynolds Lewis called video interviewing through HireVue and similar companies a "potentially terrifying innovation." Writing for ''Business Insider'', Kevin Feloni opined that HireVue's strength is also its "potential weakness", stating "the AI learns from the employee pool hiring managers choose to feed it. It can then be customized to remove certain biases, such as vocal tics, but that is also dependent on human judgment." Harwell also noted that the company's prominence led to universities making "special efforts to train students on how to look and speak" to generate optimal results. CNBC's Tonya Riley wrote that HireVue and similar companies "boast speed as a key for why more and more recruiters are relying on their services."

Harwell cited Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the New York-based research center, the AI Now Institute. Whittaker called HireVue's AI technology a "profoundly disturbing development", as well as "pseudoscience" and a "license to discriminate."
