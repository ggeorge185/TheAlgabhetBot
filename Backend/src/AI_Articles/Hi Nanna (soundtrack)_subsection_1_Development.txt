Hi Nanna'' is Wahab's second Telugu film after Kushi (2023 film)|''Kushi'' (2023). He described it as an "imperative" process scoring the film which reflects the tranquility of the visuals and production design and has composed music for the background at situations where the story demands it. The music had been recorded at his home studio in Kochi and other recording studios in Hyderabad, Chennai and Mumbai.

Upon the song "Samayama" released, it was compared with Wahab's own Malayalam song "Darshana" from ''Hridayam'' (2022) to which he claimed that only the first note of the song was similar to that, but he did not rehash the tunes as he was very particular on giving something fresh to audience. The track "Odiyamma" was conceptualized with the intention to subdue the emotional tonality. It was sung by actor Dhruv Vikram in his Telugu debut, who agreed to Shouryuv's suggestion on him crooning vocals for that song and went to Hyderabad in person to record it which he did in 2â€“3 days.

Wahab incorporated artificial intelligence for re-recording the film's score, thereby becoming the first in India to do so.
