X'' is a Bayesian network with respect to ''G'' if it satisfies the ''local Markov property'': each variable is Conditional independence|conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parent variables:

:<math> X_v \perp\!\!\!\perp X_(v)} \mid X_(v)} \quad\textv \in V</math>

where de(''v'') is the set of descendants and ''V''&nbsp;\&nbsp;de(''v'') is the set of non-descendants of ''v''.

This can be expressed in terms similar to the first definition, as

:<math>
\begin
& \operatorname P(X_v=x_v \mid  X_i=x_i \text X_i \text X_v\, ) \\[6pt]
=  & P(X_v=x_v \mid X_j=x_j \text X_j \text X_v\, )
\end
</math>

The set of parents is a subset of the set of non-descendants because the graph is Cycle (graph theory)|acyclic.
