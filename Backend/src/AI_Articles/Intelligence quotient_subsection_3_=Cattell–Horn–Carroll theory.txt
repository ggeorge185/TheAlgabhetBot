Raymond Cattell (1941) proposed two types of cognitive abilities in a revision of Spearman's concept of general intelligence. Fluid intelligence (Gf) was hypothesized as the ability to solve novel problems by using reasoning, and crystallized intelligence (Gc) was hypothesized as a knowledge-based ability that was very dependent on education and experience. In addition, fluid intelligence was hypothesized to decline with age, while crystallized intelligence was largely resistant to the effects of aging. The theory was almost forgotten, but was revived by his student John L. Horn (1966) who later argued Gf and Gc were only two among several factors, and who eventually identified nine or ten broad abilities. The theory continued to be called Gf-Gc theory.}}

In 1999, a merging of the Gf-Gc theory of Cattell and Horn with Carroll's Three-Stratum theory has led to the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory (CHC Theory), with ''g'' as the top of the hierarchy, ten broad abilities below, and further subdivided into seventy narrow abilities on the third stratum. CHC Theory has greatly influenced many of the current broad IQ tests. According to Vygotsky, the maximum level of complexity and difficulty of problems that a child is capable to solve under some guidance indicates their level of potential development. The difference between this level of potential and the lower level of unassisted performance indicates the child's zone of proximal development. Combination of the two indexesthe level of actual and the zone of the proximal developmentaccording to Vygotsky, provides a significantly more informative indicator of psychological development than the assessment of the level of actual development alone. His ideas on the zone of development were later developed in a number of psychological and educational theories and practices, most notably under the banner of dynamic assessment, which seeks to measure developmental potential}} (for instance, in the work of Reuven Feuerstein and his associates, who has Reuven Feuerstein#Difference between IQ test and Dynamic Assessment|criticized standard IQ testing for its putative assumption or acceptance of "fixed and immutable" characteristics of intelligence or cognitive functioning). Dynamic assessment has been further elaborated in the work of Ann Brown, and John D. Bransford and in theories of multiple intelligences authored by Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg.

J.P. Guilford's J.P. Guilford#Guilford's Structure of Intellect|Structure of Intellect (1967) model of intelligence used three dimensions, which, when combined, yielded a total of 120 types of intelligence. It was popular in the 1970s and early 1980s, but faded owing to both practical problems and theoretical criticisms. It has influenced some recent IQ tests, and been seen as a complement to the Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory described above. The most commonly used individual IQ test series is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) for adults and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) for school-age test-takers. Other commonly used individual IQ tests (some of which do not label their standard scores as "IQ" scores) include the current versions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales, Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, the Cognitive Assessment System, and the Differential Ability Scales.

There are various other IQ tests, including:
# Raven's Progressive Matrices
# Cattell Culture Fair III
# Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales
# Primary Mental Abilities Test|Thurstone's Primary Mental Abilities
# Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test
# Multidimensional Aptitude Battery II
# Das–Naglieri cognitive assessment system
# Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test
#Wide Range Intelligence Test

IQ scales are Ordinal scale|ordinally scaled. The Test score|raw score of the norming Sample (statistics)|sample is usually (rank order) Data transformation (statistics)|transformed to a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. Reliability represents the measurement consistency of a test. A reliable test produces similar scores upon repetition. Reported standard error may be an underestimate, as it does not account for all sources of error.

Outside influences such as low motivation or high anxiety can occasionally lower a person's IQ test score. By the same token, high IQ scores are also significantly less reliable than those near to the population median. Reports of IQ scores much higher than 160 are considered dubious.
