Boyer-Moore Theorem Prover (NQTHM)
:The design of Nqthm|NQTHM was influenced by John McCarthy and Woody Bledsoe. Started in 1971 at Edinburgh, Scotland, this was a fully automatic theorem prover built using Pure Lisp (programming language)|Lisp. The main aspects of NQTHM were:
:# the use of Lisp as a working logic.
:# the reliance on a principle of definition for total recursive functions.
:# the extensive use of rewriting and "symbolic evaluation".
:# an induction heuristic based the failure of symbolic evaluation.

;HOL Light
:Written in OCaml, HOL Light is designed to have a simple and clean logical foundation and an uncluttered implementation. It is essentially another proof assistant for classical higher order logic.

;Coq
:Developed in France, Coq (software)|Coq is another automated proof assistant, which can automatically extract executable programs from specifications, as either Objective CAML or Haskell (programming language)|Haskell source code. Properties, programs and proofs are formalized in the same language called the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC).
