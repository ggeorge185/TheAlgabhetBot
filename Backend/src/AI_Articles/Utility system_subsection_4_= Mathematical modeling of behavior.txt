In The Sims (2000) an NPCs current "need" for something (e.g. rest, food, social activity) was combined with a score from an object or activity that could satisfy that same need. The combinations of these values gave a score to the action that told the Sim what it should do. This was one of the first ''visible'' uses of utility AI in a game. While the player didn't see the calculations themselves, they were made aware of the relative needs of the Sim and the varying degrees of satisfaction that objects in the game would provide. It was, in fact, the core gameplay mechanism.

In The Sims 3 (2009), Richard Evans used a modified version of the Boltzmann distribution to choose an action for a Sim, using a Thermodynamic temperature|temperature that is low when the Sim is happy, and high when the Sim is doing badly to make it more likely that an action with a low utility is chosen. He also incorporated "personalities" into the Sims. This created a sort of 3-axis model â€” extending the numeric "needs" and "satisfaction values" to include preferences so that different NPCs might react differently from others in the same circumstances based on their internal wants and drives.
 
In his book, ''Behavioral Mathematics for Game AI'', Dave Mark detailed how to mentally think of behavior in terms of math including such things as response curves (converting changing input variables to output variables). He and Kevin Dill went on to give many of the early lectures on utility theory at the AI Summit of the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco including "Improving AI Decision Modeling Through Utility Theory" in 2010. and "Embracing the Dark Art of Mathematical Modeling in AI" in 2012. These lectures served to inject utility AI as a commonly-referred-to architecture alongside finite state machines (FSMs), behavior trees, and planners.
