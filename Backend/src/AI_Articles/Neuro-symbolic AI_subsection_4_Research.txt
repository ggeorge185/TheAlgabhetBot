Many key research questions remain, such as:
* What is the best way to integrate neural and symbolic architectures?
* How should symbolic structures be represented within neural networks and extracted from them?
* How should common-sense knowledge be learned and reasoned about?
* How can abstract knowledge that is hard to encode logically be handled?
