The Free Software Foundation expressed concerns that code snippets generated by Copilot and Codex could copyright infringement|violate copyright, in particular the condition of the GPL that requires derivative works to be licensed under equivalent terms. Issues they raised include whether training on public repositories falls into fair use or not, how developers could discover infringing generated code, whether trained machine learning models could be considered modifiable source code or a compilation of the training data, and if machine learning models could themselves be copyrighted and by whom. An internal GitHub study found that approximately 0.1% of generated code contained direct copies from the training data. In one example the model outputted the training data code implementing the fast inverse square root algorithm, including comments and an incorrect copyright notice. However, use of text snippets from books provides for a reliable reference of the copyright owner, as opposed to compiled works used for the training algorithm data where the final output is made without any such reference.
