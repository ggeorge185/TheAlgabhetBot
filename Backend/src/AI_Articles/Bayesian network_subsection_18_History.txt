The term Bayesian network was coined by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize:

*the often subjective nature of the input information
*the reliance on Bayes' conditioning as the basis for updating information
*the distinction between causal and evidential modes of reasoning

In the late 1980s Pearl's ''Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems'' and Richard E. Neapolitan|Neapolitan's ''Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems'' summarized their properties and established them as a field of study.
