* '''Dr. William Daughton''' - TSA Chief Engineer, played by Victor Navone in ''The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time'' and David Fenner in ''The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time''
* '''Jack Baldwin''' - TSA Commissioner, played by Daniel Mann
*'''Arthur''' - Arthur is an artificial intelligence created by Dr. Kenneth Farnstein on a derelict asteroid miner parked in the outer reaches of the solar system. Arthur was first introduced in ''Journeyman Project 2: Buried In Time''. From the beginning, he was combination comic relief and interactive strategy guide|strategy or hint guide. In ''Buried in Time'', he was present for a great deal of the game, and he returned in ''The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time'' for essentially the entire game. Players would click upon icons in his interface, which would present themselves at certain times. One icon would dispense a quip or general observation, and another would dispense a hint, and often as not a quip as well. His skills and knowledge include his talent as an accomplished artist, knowledge about 20th century pop culture, and mastery of computers. For both ''The Journeyman Project 2'' and ''The Journeyman Project 3'', Arthur's voice was supplied by Matt Weinhold who also wrote additional dialog for his character.
*'''Dr. Elliot Sinclair''' - Dr. Sinclair is popularly known in the world of ''The Journeyman Project'' as "the father of time travel" because he invented the first time machine, a large device known as Pegasus. His pioneering work became the basis of, and ''raison d'Ãªtre'' for, the Temporal Security Annex, which became the Temporal Security Agency. Dr. William Daughton later improved upon his initial work to create the JumpSuit time machines for the Temporal Security Agency. During most of the first part of the first game, ''The Journeyman Project'', the player knows of Dr. Elliot Sinclair, if at all, only as the person who invented time travel. Only once the player is able to defeat one of the robots damaging history do they learn that Dr. Sinclair is the antagonist of the game. Dr. Elliot Sinclair spends the second game, ''The Journeyman Project 2'', incarcerated in Vega Thalon, a prison colony on one of Saturn's moons. He, his robotic henchmen, and the Pegasus device are occasionally referred to but are not relevant to the story. He returns to the storyline for ''The Journeyman Project 3'', where Blackwood learns that Sinclair was born in Atlantis, which was destroyed by the Symbiotry in 1262 B.C, explaining Sinclair's mistrust of them in the present. Although immortal thanks to an alien artifact hidden in Atlantis, Sinclair dies five days before the game begins, as his immortality slowly failed after leaving Earth. In all three games (although his entire appearance in the second game was portions of what he'd done in the first game) Dr. Elliot Sinclair was portrayed by Graham Jarvis.
