Main|Cultured meat}}

''Cultured meat'', also called ''in vitro meat'', ''clean meat'', ''cruelty-free meat'', ''shmeat'', and ''test-tube meat'', is an animal-flesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the fetal calf serum taken from a slaughtered cow.  In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on ''in vitro'' meat in the laboratory. The Cultured meat#First public trial|first in vitro beefburger, created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013. There remain difficulties to be overcome before ''in vitro'' meat becomes commercially available. Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves. ''In vitro'' meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it does not involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.
