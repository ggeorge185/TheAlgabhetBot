Economic approaches to creativity have focused on three aspects â€“ the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modeling markets for creativity, and the maximization of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of ''creative destruction'' to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital (economics)|capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.

Mark A. Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic" model of creativity. In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticized for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility, and for the way it analyzes the value of future innovations.

The ''creative class'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent, and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development.
