John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney developed the first computer-generated art in the early 1960s by utilizing mathematical operations to create art. In 1963, Ivan Sutherland invented the first user interactive computer-graphics interface known as Sketchpad.
Between 1974 and 1977, Salvador Dal√≠ created two big canvases of ''Gala Contemplating the Mediterranean Sea which at a distance of 20 meters is transformed into the portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to Rothko)'' and prints of ''Lincoln in Dalivision'' based on a portrait of Abraham Lincoln processed on a computer by Leon Harmon published in "The Recognition of Faces".
The technique is similar to what later became known as photographic mosaics.

Andy Warhol created digital art using an Amiga where the computer was publicly introduced at the Lincoln Center, New York, in July 1985. An image of Debbie Harry was captured in monochrome from a video camera and digitized into a graphics program called ProPaint. Warhol manipulated the image by adding color using flood fills.
