The evolution of human intelligence refers to several theories that aim to describe how human intelligence has evolution|evolved in relation to the evolution of the human brain and the origin of language.

The timeline of human evolution spans some 7 million years, from the separation of the genus ''Pan (genus)|Pan'' until the emergence of behavioral modernity by 50,000 years ago. Of this timeline, the first 3 million years concern ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Sahelanthropus'', the following 2 million concern ''Australopithecus'', while the final 2 million span the history of actual ''Homo (genus)|Homo'' species (the Paleolithic).

Many traits of human intelligence, such as empathy, theory of mind, mourning, ritual, and the use of Great ape language|symbols and tools, are already apparent in great apes although in lesser sophistication than in humans.

There is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence, or "Behavioural modernity#Great leap forward|Great leap forward" and those of a gradual or Behavioural modernity#Continuum hypothesis|continuum hypothesis.

Theories of the evolution of intelligence include:
* Robin Dunbar's social brain hypothesis
* Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller's sexual selection hypothesis concerning Sexual selection in human evolution
* The ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC) explained by Mark V. Flinn, David C. Geary and Carol V. Ward based mainly on work by Richard D. Alexander.
* The idea of intelligence as a signal of good health and resistance to disease.
* The Group selection theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group (clan, tribe, or larger population) can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above.
* The idea that intelligence is connected with nutrition, and thereby with status. A higher IQ could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high, and vice versa.
