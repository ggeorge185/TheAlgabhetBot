On April 7, 2022, a display for the product was featured at the Tesla Giga Texas manufacturing facility during the Cyber Rodeo event. Musk said that he hopes to have the robot production-ready by 2023 and claimed Optimus will eventually be able to do "anything that humans don’t want to do."

In September 2022, semi-functional prototypes of Optimus were displayed at Tesla's second AI Day. One prototype was able to walk about the stage and another, sleeker version could move its arms.

In September 2023, Tesla released a video demonstrating Optimus doing new activities including sorting colored blocks by color, its ability to locate its limbs in space and demonstrating its flexibility by maintaining a yoga pose.
