Generative AI's ability to create realistic fake content has been exploited in numerous types of cybercrime, including phishing scams. Deepfake video and audio have been used to create disinformation and fraud. Former Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has predicted that while deepfake videos initially created a stir in the media, they would soon become commonplace, and as a result, more dangerous. Additionally, large-language models and other forms of text-generation AI have been at a broad scale to create fake reviews on e-commerce websites to boost ratings. Cybercriminals have created large language models focused on fraud, including WormGPT and FraudGPT.

Recent research done in 2023 has revealed that generative AI has weaknesses that can be manipulated by criminals to extract harmful information bypassing ethical safeguards. The study presents example attacks done on ChatGPT including Jailbreaks and reverse psychology. Additionally, malicious individuals can use ChatGPT for Social engineering (security)|social engineering attacks and Phishing|phishing attacks, revealing the harmful side of these technologies.
