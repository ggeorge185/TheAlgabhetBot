Effective accelerationism diverges from the principles of effective altruism, which prioritizes using evidence and reasoning to identify the most effective ways to altruistically improve the world, often through charitable actions. In contrast, effective accelerationism emphasizes the transformative potential of technology and capitalism as a means to achieve societal change.

Accelerationists argue that those who advocate for regulatory measures and safeguards in technological development are tantamount to murderers, stemming from their belief that such precautions hinder the progress that could potentially yield life-saving artificial intelligence.

In her 2023 essay "Effective obfuscation", Molly White (writer)|Molly White critiques the movement, suggesting it merely provides a superficial philosophical cover for the industry's traditional motives and behaviors. She further argues that a tech industry "led by a bunch of techno-utopianists and those who think they can reduce everything to markets and equations" has already been attempted, primarily serving as a tool for the wealthy to retroactively justify their choices rather than influencing meaningful decision-making. White advocates for recognizing and valuing "the expertise of those who have been working to improve technology for the better of all rather than just for themselves and the few just like them".

In a similar vein, Ellen Huet argued on Bloomberg News|''Bloomberg News'' that some of the ideas of the movement were "deeply unsettling", focusing especially on Guillaume Verdon's "post-humanism" and the view that "natural selection could lead AI to replace us [humans] as the dominant species."
