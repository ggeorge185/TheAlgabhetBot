''Théâtre D'opéra Spatial'' winning the Colorado State Fair's contest for "digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography" led to a backlash from artists who accused the winner, Jason Michael Allen, of cheating. Allen responded: "I'm not going to apologize for it. I won, and I didn't break any rules."
