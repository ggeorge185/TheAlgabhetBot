Examples of Macro-engineering on vast scales feature prominently in the ''Star Wars'' films and other media. The most famous example is the Death Star from the original ''Star Wars (film)|Star Wars'' film. A giant battle station which is said to be  in diameter, it was built in secret over a twenty-year period and operated with a crew of over one million. The Death Star II which appears in ''Return of the Jedi'' is even larger at  in diameter.  The flagship of the First Order that appears in ''The Last Jedi'', the ''Supremacy'', is a ''Mega''-class Star Destroyer  wide and a crew of over two million.

As part of a team project, a group of students at Lehigh University in 2012 attempted to determine the cost and time needed to build a Death Star. They determined that the amount of steel alone needed to build a Death Star was  (or 1.08 quadrillion) metric ton|tons, which at then-current production rates would take 833,315 years and cost $852 quadrillion USD. They also estimated that the total amount of mineable iron ore in the Earth would be enough to build two billion Death Stars. Zachary Feinstein, an assistant professor at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, estimated that the total cost for the first Death Star would amount to $193 quintillion USD. Conversely, he estimated that the cost of building Starkiller Base would be a fraction of that price at $9.315 quintillion USD, but only if it was naturally able to maintain a self-sustaining atmosphere.
