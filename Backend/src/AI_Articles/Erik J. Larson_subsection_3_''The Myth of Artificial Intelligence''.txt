Larson's book, ''The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do'' ( ) was published by Harvard University Press on April 6, 2021. In the book, "Larson argues that AI hype is both bad science and bad for science. A culture of invention thrives on exploring unknowns, not overselling existing methods. Inductive AI will continue to improve at narrow tasks, but if we want to make real progress, we will need to start by more fully appreciating the only true intelligence we know—our own." 

In his endorsement of ''The Myth of Artificial Intelligence'', venture capitalist Peter Thiel wrote "If you want to know about AI, read this book...it shows how a supposedly futuristic reverence for Artificial Intelligence retards progress when it denigrates our most irreplaceable resource for any future progress: our own human intelligence.” The book also received endorsements from writer John Horgan (journalist)|John Horgan and CEO of the Allen Institute for AI|Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence Oren Etzioni. It has been reviewed for The Critic (modern magazine)|The Critic, Engadget, Fast Company, Financial Times|The Financial Times, Inside Story, The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis, The New York Review of Books, Prometheus: Critical Studies in Innovation, R&A Enterprise Architecture, Tech Monitor, TechTalks, The Times Literary Supplement, Towards Data Science, The Village Voice, The Wall Street Journal, and The Wire (India)|The Wire India.
