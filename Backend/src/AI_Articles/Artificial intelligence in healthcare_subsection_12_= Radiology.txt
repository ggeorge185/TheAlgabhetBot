AI is being studied within the field of radiology to detect and diagnose diseases through Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging. It may be particularly useful in settings where demand for human expertise exceeds supply, or where data is too complex to be efficiently interpreted by human readers. Several deep learning models have shown the capability to be roughly as accurate as healthcare professionals in identifying diseases through medical imaging, though few of the studies reporting these findings have been externally validated. AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, and automatically assessing image quality. Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies. The analysis of images for supervised AI applications in radiology encompasses two primary techniques at present: (1) Convolutional neural network|convolutional neural network-based analysis; and (2) utilization of radiomics.
