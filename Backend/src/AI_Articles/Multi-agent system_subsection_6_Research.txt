The study of multi-agent systems is "concerned with the development and analysis of sophisticated artificial intelligence|AI problem-solving and control architectures for both single-agent and multiple-agent systems." Research topics include:
* agent-oriented software engineering
* beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDI software agent|BDI)
* Consensus dynamics|cooperation and coordination
* distributed constraint optimization (DCOPs)
* organization
* communication
* negotiation
* cooperative distributed problem solving|distributed problem solving
*multi-agent learning
* agent mining 
* scientific communities (e.g., on biological flocking, language evolution, and economics)
* dependability and fault-tolerance
* robotics, multi-robot systems (MRS), robotic clusters
* multi-agent systems also present possible applications in microrobotics, where the physical interaction between the agents are exploited to perform complex tasks such as manipulation and assembly of passive components.
