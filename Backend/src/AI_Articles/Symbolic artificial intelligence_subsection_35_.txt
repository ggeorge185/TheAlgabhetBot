Main|Knowledge Representation}}

Semantic networks, conceptual graphs, Frame (artificial intelligence)|frames, and formal logic|logic are all approaches to modeling knowledge such as domain knowledge, problem-solving knowledge, and the semantic meaning of language. Ontologies model key concepts and their relationships in a domain. Example ontologies are YAGO (database)|YAGO, WordNet, and Upper ontology#DOLCE|DOLCE. Upper ontology#DOLCE|DOLCE is an example of an upper ontology that can be used for any domain while WordNet is a lexical resource that can also be viewed as an upper ontology#WordNet|ontology. YAGO incorporates WordNet as part of its ontology, to align facts extracted from Wikipedia with WordNet synsets. The Disease Ontology is an example of a medical ontology currently being used.

Description logic is a logic for automated classification of ontologies and for detecting inconsistent classification data. Web Ontology Language|OWL is a language used to represent ontologies with description logic. Protégé (software)|Protégé is an ontology editor that can read in Web Ontology Language|OWL ontologies and then check consistency with deductive classifiers such as such as HermiT.

First-order logic is more general than description logic. The automated theorem provers discussed below can prove theorems in first-order logic. Horn clause logic is more restricted than first-order logic and is used in logic programming languages such as Prolog. Extensions to first-order logic include temporal logic, to handle time; epistemic logic, to reason about agent knowledge; modal logic, to handle possibility and necessity; and probabilistic logics to handle logic and probability together.
