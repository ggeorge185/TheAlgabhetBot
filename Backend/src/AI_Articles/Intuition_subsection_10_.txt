Early mentions and definitions of intuition can be traced back to Plato. In his ''Plato Republic|Republic'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human reason to comprehend the true nature of reality. In his works ''Meno (Plato)|Meno'' and ''Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity", and as a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis. The study was later continued by his intellectual successors, the Neoplatonists.
