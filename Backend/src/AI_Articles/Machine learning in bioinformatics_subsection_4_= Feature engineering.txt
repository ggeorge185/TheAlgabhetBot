The way that features, often vectors in a many-dimensional space, are extracted from the domain data is an important component of learning systems. In genomics, a typical representation of a sequence is a vector of k-mers frequencies, which is a vector of dimension <math>4^k</math> whose entries count the appearance of each subsequence of length <math>k</math> in a given sequence. Since for a value as small as <math>k=12</math> the dimensionality of these vectors is huge (e.g. in this case the dimension is <math>4^ \approx 16\times 10^6</math>), techniques such as principal component analysis are used to project the data to a lower dimensional space, thus selecting a smaller set of features from the sequences. HMMs can be formulated in continuous time.

HMMs can be used to profile and convert a multiple sequence alignment into a position-specific scoring system suitable for searching databases for homologous sequences remotely. Additionally, ecological phenomena can be described by HMMs.
