The main difference between SAIL and other ALGOL-derived languages was its inclusion of the Associative array|associative store from the LEAP language. This system provided a system that allowed data to be placed in record-like structures and then saved, retrieved and searched. In this respect it was similar to the data handling features in COBOL. The basis for the store was the ''association'' or ''triple'', which allowed a data value to be associated with a named slot in a record. For instance, one might make a record of the type  with  "Tom" and set the  field to "Harry". This results in a triple of the form (Father, Tom, Harry). The associated libraries could then find all the s with "Harry" as the , perhaps returning "Tom" and "Alice".
