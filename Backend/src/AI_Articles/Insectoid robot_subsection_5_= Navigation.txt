Flying insects have poor visual spatial resolution, must respond rapidly, and have little to no advanced neural processing power.  Due to limitations of space and weight, flying insectoid robots have a very similar set of problems.  In 2003, Franceschini ''et al.'' investigated the possibility of using insect solutions to solve robot navigation problems.  Franceschini built a research robot based on the neural physiology of a fly.  The robot was not actually a flying robot, rather, it was a wheeled vehicle.  The aim of the research was to show that simple sensor-motor control using only visual motion detection could navigate a course.

Using insect intelligence in robot navigation has been going on since 1986, but initially was not taken up by engineers building robots.  It was felt that because insects lack a visual cortex, and hence cannot perform advanced visual processing and image formation, a robot based on such technology would not be very successful.  Franceschini argues that it is not necessary to possess a visual cortex for the navigation task, and it would in fact be an unnecessary burden on an insect robot (both weight and processing time would be issues).  Franceschini points out that many of the visual systems in humans do not pass through the visual cortex either.  It is not always necessary to form images and identify objects.
