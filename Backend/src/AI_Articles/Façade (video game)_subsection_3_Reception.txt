Façade'' received contemporary praise from mainstream publications as an example of the burgeoning potential of artificial intelligence in the design of video games. Describing the title as "the future of videogames...where games are driven as strongly by characters as combat", the ''New York Times'' praised the game's use of "advanced artificial intelligence techniques...to change (the characters') emotional state in fairly complicated ways". ''Newsweek'' praised the game's potential to "take character to a new depth" and design games "about people's lives" that would appeal to broader audiences, including women. NBC News suggested ''Façade'' "could represent a new step in gaming" to "evoke complex emotions" in interactive entertainment, and noted that "how (the game) attempts to meet the challenges of artificial intelligence has relevance for gaming in the future". Describing the game as "one of the most important games ever created, possibly the most important game of the last ten years", ''Game Developer'' praised the "revolutionary" and "technically ambitious" design of the game, noting its innovative experimentation with natural language processing and generation, emotional modelling, facial expressions and body language, stating "''Façade'' is important for what it tries to do and what it shows that we can do with this amazing medium".
