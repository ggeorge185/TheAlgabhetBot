Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims. There are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth. Philosophers such as George Bealer have tried to defend appeals to intuition against Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis.

A different challenge to appeals to intuition comes from experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers, who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.

The metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical assumption that philosophy ought to depend on intuitions has been challenged by experimental philosophers (e.g., Stephen Stich). One of the main problems adduced by experimental philosophers is that intuitions differ, for instance, from one culture to another, and so it seems problematic to cite them as evidence for a philosophical claim. Timothy Williamson responded to such objections against philosophical methodology by arguing that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general skepticism about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences, or mathematics. Others like Ernest Sosa seek to support intuition by arguing that the objections against intuition merely highlight .
