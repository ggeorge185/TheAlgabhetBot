Neuro-sama was created by developer vedal987. Her responses to the audience are generated from a large language model, which a Text-to-speech|text-to-speech application converts into a "cutesy voice". According to Vedal, a separate AI model controls her in-game actions when she plays video games. In an interview with ''Bloomberg News|Bloomberg'', he said that Neuro-sama was his full-time job. Her new design was implemented on 27 May 2023.
