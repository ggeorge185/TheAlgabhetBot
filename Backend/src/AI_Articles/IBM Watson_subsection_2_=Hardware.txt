The system is workload-optimized, integrating massively parallel POWER7 processors and built on IBM's ''DeepQA'' technology, which it uses to generate hypotheses, gather massive evidence, and analyze data. IBM IBM Master Inventor|master inventor and senior consultant Tony Pearson estimated Watson's hardware cost at about three million dollars. Its Linpack performance stands at 80 TeraFLOPs, which is about half as fast as the cut-off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list. According to Rennie, all content was stored in Watson's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to compete with human Jeopardy champions. The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents, including dictionaries, encyclopedias and other reference material, that it could use to build its knowledge.
