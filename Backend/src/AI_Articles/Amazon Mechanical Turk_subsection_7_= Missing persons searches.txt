In September 2007, a similar arrangement was repeated in the Steve Fossett search|search for aviator Steve Fossett. Satellite data was divided into  sections, and Mechanical Turk users were asked to flag images with "foreign objects" that might be a crash site or other evidence that should be examined more closely.
