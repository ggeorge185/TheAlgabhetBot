One Cyc application aims to help students doing math at a 6th grade level, helping them much more deeply understand that subject matter.  It is based on the experience that we often have ''thought'' we understood something, but only ''really'' understood it after we had to explain or teach it to someone else.  Unlike almost all other educational software, where the computer plays the role of the teacher, this application of Cyc, called MathCraft, has Cyc play the role of a fellow student who is always slightly more confused than you, the user, are about the subject.  The user's role is to observe the Cyc avatar and give it advice, correct its errors, mentor it, get it to see what it's doing wrong, etc.  As the user gives good advice, Cyc allows the avatar to make fewer mistakes of that type, hence, from the user's point of view, it seems as though the user has just successfully taught it something.  This is a variation of learning by teaching.
