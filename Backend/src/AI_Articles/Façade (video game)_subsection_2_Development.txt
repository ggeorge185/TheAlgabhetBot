Façade'' was developed by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. Prior to development, Mateas was a doctoral student at the Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, and Stern was a programmer and designer on the virtual pet video game series Petz. Mateas and Stern met presenting at a series of conferences on the intersection of artificial intelligence and interactive entertainment, and began initial work in 1998 on a long-term "interactive drama piece" and "commercial product prototype". In 2000, Mateas and Stern formally commenced a full-time collaborative project to "build an interactive story world integrating believable agents and interactive plot", with a plan to create a game around a "domestic drama in which a married couple has invited a player over for dinner." To develop organic and believable character behaviors, Mateas and Stern developed a complex programming framework described as 'a behavior language' to program and organize the expressions of multiple characters as 'believable agents'. ''Façade'' was released for Microsoft Windows|Windows in July 2005 as a free download from the developer's web site.

Following the release of ''Façade'', Mateas and Stern planned to create a follow-up project titled ''The Party''. Building on the design of ''Façade'', ''The Party'' was planned to feature around the plot of being invited a dinner party, in which gameplay would be expanded to accommodate ten characters, greater environmental interaction, and more mature complex narrative beats, including sex and violence. In 2013, Mateas confirmed that development on ''The Party'' had ceased to pursue other projects.
