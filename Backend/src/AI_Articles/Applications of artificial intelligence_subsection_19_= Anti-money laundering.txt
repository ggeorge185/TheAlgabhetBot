AI software, such as LaundroGraph which uses contemporary suboptimal datasets, could be used for anti-money laundering (AML). AI can be used to "develop the AML pipeline into a robust, scalable solution with a reduced false positive rate and high adaptability". A study about deep learning for AML identified "key challenges for researchers" to have "access to recent real transaction data and scarcity of labelled training data; and data being highly imbalanced" and suggests future research should bring-out "explainable artificial intelligence|explainability, graph deep learning using natural language processing (NLP), unsupervised and reinforcement learning to handle lack of labeled data|labelled data; and joint research programs between the research community and industry to benefit from domain knowledge and controlled access to data".
