The most important attribute of a system driven by situated AI is that the intelligence is controlled by a set of independent semi-Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous modules. In the original systems, each module was actually a separate peripheral|device or was at least conceived of as running on its own Process (computing)|processing thread (computer science)|thread. Generally, though, the modules are just abstractions. In this respect, situated AI may be seen as a software engineering approach to AI, perhaps akin to object-oriented programming|object oriented design.

Situated AI is often associated with reactive planning, but the two are not synonymous. Brooks advocated an extreme version of cognitive minimalism which required initially that the behavior modules were finite state machines and thus contained no conventional memory or learning. This is associated with reactive AI because reactive AI requires reacting to the current state of the world, not to an Intelligent agent|agent's memory or preconception of that world. However, learning is obviously key to realistic Artificial general intelligence|strong AI, so this constraint has been relaxed, though not entirely abandoned.
