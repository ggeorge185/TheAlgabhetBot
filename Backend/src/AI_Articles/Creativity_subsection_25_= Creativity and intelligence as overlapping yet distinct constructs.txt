This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs, for example:

* In Renzulli's Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness, giftedness is an overlap of above-average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they overlap under the correct conditions.
* In the PASS theory of intelligence, the planning component – the ability to solve problems, make decisions, and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.
*Threshold Theory (TT) derives from a number of previous research findings that suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak. TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of TT, Frank Barron (psychologist)|Barron found a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r''=0.3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp ''et al.'' in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from ''r''=0.19 to ''r''=0.49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were ''r''≤0.12. Cho ''et al.'' reported a correlation of 0.40 between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults; and a correlation of close to ''r''=0.0 for the high IQ group. Jauk ''et al.'' found support for the TT, but only for measures of creative potential, not creative performance.

By contrast, other research reports findings against TT. Wai ''et al.'', using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim's meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel ''et al.'', investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r''=0.3 to ''r''=0.4 across all levels of cognitive ability.
