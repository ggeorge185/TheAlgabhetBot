Formally, Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) whose nodes represent variables in the Bayesian probability|Bayesian sense: they may be observable quantities, latent variables, unknown parameters or hypotheses. Each edge represents a direct conditional dependency. Any pair of nodes that are not connected (i.e. no path connects one node to the other) represent variables that are conditional independence|conditionally independent of each other. Each node is associated with a Probability distribution|probability function that takes, as input, a particular set of values for the node's Glossary of graph theory#Directed acyclic graphs|parent variables, and gives (as output) the probability (or probability distribution, if applicable) of the variable represented by the node. For example, if <math>m</math> parent nodes represent <math>m</math> Boolean data type|Boolean variables, then the probability function could be represented by a table of <small><math>2^m</math></small> entries, one entry for each of the <small><math>2^m</math></small> possible parent combinations. Similar ideas may be applied to undirected, and possibly cyclic, graphs such as Markov networks.
