Further|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}
In ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', J.A.R.V.I.S. is seemingly destroyed by Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron, but he was able to save himself by distributing his "consciousness" throughout the Internet, allowing his security protocols to delay Ultron's attempt to access Earth's nuclear launch codes long enough for Stark to work out what had happened. Stark and Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner use J.A.R.V.I.S. as the core software for the android Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision while F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|F.R.I.D.A.Y. takes his place as Stark's assistant. After gaining a physical body, J.A.R.V.I.S. (as Vision) considers himself to not be J.A.R.V.I.S. anymore, but to simply be Vision.
