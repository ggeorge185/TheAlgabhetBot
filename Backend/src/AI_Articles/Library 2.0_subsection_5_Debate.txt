Library 2.0 has been a source of debate in the blogosphere.  Some librarian bloggers have argued that these key principles are not new and have been part of the service philosophies of many library reformers since the 19th century.  Others are calling for more concrete examples of how libraries can get to Library 2.0. Walt Crawford, for example, argues that Library 2.0 comprises a combination of tools and attitudes which are excellent ideas and not new to librarianship, a few business- and tool-focused attitudes which will not serve all users and user communities, and incorrectly places libraries as the appropriate source for all users to gather all information.

Proponents of Library 2.0, such as Stephen Abram, Michael Stephens, Paul Miller and others, have spoken to these criticisms, arguing that while individual pieces of Library 2.0 may not be entirely new, the convergence of these service goals and ideas with many new Web 2.0 technologies has led to a new generation of library service. This includes the use of online social networks by libraries.

Library 4.0 has been proposed as including makerspaces, Context awareness|context-aware technology, open source, big data, cloud services, augmented reality, and state-of-the-art displays.
