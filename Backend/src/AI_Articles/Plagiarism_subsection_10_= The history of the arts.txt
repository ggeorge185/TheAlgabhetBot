Through all of the history of literature and History of art|of the arts in general, works of art are to a large extent repetitions of the Poetic tradition|tradition; to the entire history of artistic creativity belong plagiarism, literary theft, Appropriation (art)|appropriation, incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, thematic variation, ironic retake, parody, imitation, stylistic theft, pastiches, collages, and deliberate Assemblage (art)|assemblages. These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture, in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly rewritten.

Publishing another's art as one's own is sometimes called "art theft", particularly online. This usage has little direct relationship to the Art theft|theft of physical works of art.

Ruth Graham quotes T. S. Eliot—"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Bad poets deface what they take."—she notes that despite the "taboo" of plagiarism, the ill-will and embarrassment it causes in the modern context, readers seem to often forgive the past excesses of historic literary offenders.
