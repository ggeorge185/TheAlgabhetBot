This section summarizes a selection of the software and commercial projects that came out of the AAII:

* Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) ongoing development and application of PRS in collaboration with SRI International
* Distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System (dMARS) an agent-oriented development and implementation environment for building complex, distributed, time-critical systems. Developed as a C++ extension to PRS.
* Smart Whole AiR Mission Model (SWARMM) an agent-oriented simulation system developed by AAII in conjunction with and for the Air Operations Division (AOD) of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation|DSTO.
* Optimal Aircraft Sequencing using Intelligent Scheduling (OASIS) an air traffic management system written in the PRS that accurately estimated aircraft arrival time, determined an optima sequence for landings and alerted operators as to the actions required to achieve the sequence.  It was designed to reduce air traffic congestion and maximize the use of runways.  A prototype was developed for Sydney Airport using dMARS called HORIZON.
* Single Point of Contact (SPOC) was a system developed for Optus to assist customer service representatives to meet the objective to meet 98% of customer enquirers with a single point of contact with the company. The system was built using dMARS and involved a multilayer architecture.
