In 2001, Tadeusz (Tad) Szuba from the Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza|AGH University in Poland proposed a formal model for the phenomenon of collective intelligence. It is assumed to be an unconscious, random, parallel, and distributed computational process, run in mathematical logic by the social structure.

In this model, beings and information are modeled as abstract information molecules carrying expressions of mathematical logic. (or "cooperation quotient") – which can be normalized from the "individual" intelligence quotient (IQ)
