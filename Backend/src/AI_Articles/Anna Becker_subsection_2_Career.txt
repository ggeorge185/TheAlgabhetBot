While pursuing her PhD, Becker resolved an approximation algorithm|NP-complete approximation algorithm that had been unresolved for over twenty years. This made her a recognized scholar in the field. After completing her PhD, she developed an approximation technique by a factor of two. This technique is widely used today in operating systems, database systems, and VLSI chip designs.

She then founded and sold Strategy Runner, a fintech software. After this, she founded EndoTech, an algorithmic trading platform based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. As of 2023, Becker is working on Fianchetto Fund, an AI-based investing analysis platform.

Becker has also co-authored a book on Bayesian networks, which has been published widely in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence.
