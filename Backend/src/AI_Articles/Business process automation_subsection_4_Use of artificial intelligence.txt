Artificial intelligence software robots are deployed to handle unstructured data sets (like images, texts, audios) and are deployed after performing and deploying robotic process automation: They can, for instance, populate an automatic transcript from a video. The combination of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) brings autonomy for the robots, along with the capability in mastering cognitive tasks: At this stage, the robot is able to learn and improve the processes by analyzing and adapting them.

AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of BPA by enabling machines to understand natural language, interact with humans, and adapt to evolving challenges without explicit programming. In BPA, AI excels in handling unstructured data sets, such as images, texts, and audios, bringing a level of cognitive understanding to automation processes. Through the deployment of AI-powered software robots, businesses can achieve a higher degree of autonomy in handling complex tasks, such as automatic transcription from videos, thereby freeing human resources to focus on more strategic and creative endeavors. The integration of AI with BPA not only accelerates task completion but also facilitates continuous learning and improvement, as machines analyze and adapt processes over time, contributing to a more agile, efficient, and innovative business environment.
