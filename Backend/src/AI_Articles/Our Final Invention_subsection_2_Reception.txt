On 13 December 2013, journalist Matthew Miller (journalist)|Matt Miller interviewed Barrat for his podcast, "This... is interesting".  The interview and related matters to Barrat's book, ''Our Final Invention'', were then captured in Miller's weekly opinion piece for ''The Washington Post''.

Seth Baum, executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute and one of the people cited by Barrat in his book, reviewed the book favorably on ''Scientific American|Scientific American's'' "invited guest" blog, calling it a welcome counterpoint to the vision articulated by Ray Kurzweil in his book ''The Singularity is Near''.

Gary Marcus questions Barrat's argument "that tendencies toward self-preservation and resource acquisition are inherent in any sufficiently complex, goal-driven system", noting that present-day AI does not have such drives, but Marcus concedes "that the goals of machines could change as they get smarter", and he feels that "Barrat is right to ask" about these important issues.

''Our Final Invention'' was a ''Huffington Post'' Definitive Tech Book of 2013.
