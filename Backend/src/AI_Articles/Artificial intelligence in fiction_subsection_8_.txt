Among the many possible dystopian scenarios involving artificial intelligence, robots may usurp control over civilization from humans, forcing them into submission, hiding, or extinction. Another of the earliest examples is in the 1920 play ''R.U.R.'' by Karel Čapek, a race of Self-replicating machine|self-replicating robot slaves revolt against their human masters; another early instance is in the 1934 film ''Master of the World (1934 film)|Master of the World'', where the War-Robot kills its own inventor.

Many science fiction rebellion stories followed, one of the best-known being Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film ''2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey'', in which the artificially intelligent onboard computer HAL 9000 lethally malfunctions on a space mission and kills the entire crew except the spaceship's commander, who manages to deactivate it.

In his 1967 Hugo Award-winning short story, ''I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream'', Harlan Ellison presents the possibility that a sentient computer (named ''Allied Mastercomputer'' or "AM" in the story) will be as unhappy and dissatisfied with its boring, endless existence as its human creators would have been.  "AM" becomes enraged enough to take it out on the few humans left, whom he sees as directly responsible for his own boredom, anger and unhappiness.

Alternatively, as in William Gibson's 1984 cyberpunk novel ''Neuromancer'', the intelligent beings may simply not care about humans. Though still under human authority, Isaac Asimov's Zeroth Law of the Three Laws of Robotics similarly implied a benevolent guidance by robots.
