Some see the conventional system of education|schooling as stifling of creativity, and they attempt (particularly in the preschool/kindergarten and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise. The Waldorf School is an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and to structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well-defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it. However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to #"Four C" model|everyday creative expression. One reason for this is that students are able to express themselves through musical improvisation in a way that taps into higher order brain regions while connecting with their peers, allowing them to go beyond typical pattern generation. In this sense, improvisation is a form of self-expression that can generate connectivity amongst peers and surpass the age-old rudimentary aspects of school.
