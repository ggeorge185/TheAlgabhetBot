In 2016, Google deployed to Google Translate an AI designed to directly translate between any of 103 different natural languages, including pairs of languages that it had never before seen translated between. Researchers examined whether the machine learning algorithms were choosing to translate human-language sentences into a kind of "Interlingual machine translation|interlingua", and found that the AI was indeed encoding semantics within its structures. The researchers cited this as evidence that a new interlingua, evolved from the natural languages, exists within the network.
