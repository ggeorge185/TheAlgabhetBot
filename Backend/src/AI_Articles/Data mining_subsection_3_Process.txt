The ''knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process'' is commonly defined with the stages:

# Selection
# Pre-processing
# Transformation
# ''Data mining''
# Interpretation/evaluation.

The only other data mining standard named in these polls was SEMMA. However, 3â€“4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models, and Azevedo and Santos conducted a comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA in 2008.
