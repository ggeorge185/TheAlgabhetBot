In other scenarios, humanity is able to keep control over the Earth, whether by banning AI, by designing robots to be submissive (as in Asimov's works), or by having humans merge with robots. The science fiction novelist Frank Herbert explored the idea of a time when mankind might ban Artificial general intelligence|artificial intelligence (and in some interpretations, even all forms of computing technology including integrated circuits) entirely. His Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' series mentions a rebellion called the Butlerian Jihad, in which mankind defeats the smart machines and imposes a death penalty for recreating them, quoting from the fictional Orange Catholic Bible, "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind." In the ''Dune'' novels published after his death (''Hunters of Dune'', ''Sandworms of Dune''), a renegade AI overmind returns to eradicate mankind as vengeance for the Butlerian Jihad.

In some stories, humanity remains in authority over robots. Often the robots are programmed specifically to remain in service to society, as in Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. TARS and CASE from ''Interstellar (film)|''Interstellar'''' similarly demonstrate simulated human emotions and humour while continuing to acknowledge their expendability.
