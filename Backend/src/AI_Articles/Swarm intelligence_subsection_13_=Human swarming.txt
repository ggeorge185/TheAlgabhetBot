Networks of distributed users can be organized into "human swarms" through the implementation of real-time closed-loop control systems. Developed by Louis B. Rosenberg|Louis Rosenberg in 2015,Â human swarming, also called artificial swarm intelligence, allows the collective intelligence of interconnected groups of people online to be harnessed. The collective intelligence of the group often exceeds the abilities of any one member of the group. 

Stanford University School of Medicine published in 2018 a study showing that groups of human doctors, when connected together by real-time swarming algorithms, could diagnose medical conditions with substantially higher accuracy than individual doctors or groups of doctors working together using traditional crowd-sourcing methods.  In one such study, swarms of human radiologists connected together were tasked with diagnosing chest x-rays and demonstrated a 33% reduction in diagnostic errors as compared to the traditional human methods, and a 22% improvement over traditional machine-learning. 

The UCSF School of Medicine|University of California San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine released a preprint in 2021 about the diagnosis of Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI images by small groups of collaborating doctors. The study showed a 23% increase in diagnostic accuracy when using Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) technology compared to majority voting.
