There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought. Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development.
* Extropianism, an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a Proactionary principle|proactive approach to human evolution.
*Singularitarianism, a moral ideology based upon the belief that a technological singularity is possible, and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety. However, they have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness.

Viewed from the perspective of some Christian thinkers, the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a #Contempt for the flesh|denigration of the human body, characteristic of gnostic manichaean belief. The Christian Transhumanist Association was established in 2014.

Since 2009, the American Academy of Religion holds a "Transhumanism and Religion" consultation during its annual meeting, where scholars in the field of religious studies seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions; consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future, in particular the prospect of human transformation, whether by technological or other means; and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology, robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species. Prisco also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas, such as the ones of Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, to the origins of the transhumanism movement.
