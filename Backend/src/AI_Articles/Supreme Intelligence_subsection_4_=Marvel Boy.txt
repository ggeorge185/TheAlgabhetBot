The ''Marvel Boy'' mini-series by Grant Morrison featured an alternate universe version of Supremor who is an ally to Noh-Varr, the last survivor of a Kree ship that crashed to Earth. Known as ''Plex'', this Supreme Intelligence displayed a type of Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities with each type of mind being able to dominate in specific situations (i.e. "Plex-Soldiers," "Plex-Scientists" even "Plex-Murderers" and "Plex-infants") to advise the ship in which it was housed.

The Supreme Intelligence did show an ability to dominate Earth technology remotely and to teleport itself and the ship short distances. It was also shown to control insectlike creatures that inhabited the ship. All these powers were achieved via transmission of a signal called "The Omni-Wave."
