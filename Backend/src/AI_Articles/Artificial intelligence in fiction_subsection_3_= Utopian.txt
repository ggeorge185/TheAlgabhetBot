Optimistic visions of the future of artificial intelligence are possible in science fiction. Benign AI characters include Robby in ''Lost in Space'', from 1965 to 1968; Data (Star Trek)|Data in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' from 1987 to 1994; and Pixar's WALL-E in 2008. Iain Banks's The Culture (series)|''Culture'' series of novels portrays a utopian, Post-scarcity economy|post-scarcity space society of humanoids, extraterrestrial life|aliens, and advanced beings with artificial intelligence living in socialism|socialist habitats across the Milky Way. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have identified four major themes in utopian scenarios featuring AI: ''immortality'', or indefinite lifespans; ''ease'', or freedom from the need to work; ''gratification'', or pleasure and entertainment provided by machines; and ''dominance'', the power to protect oneself or rule over others.

Alexander Wiegel contrasts the role of AI in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and in Duncan Jones's 2009 film ''Moon (2009 film)|Moon''. Whereas in 1968, Wiegel argues, the public felt "technology paranoia" and the AI computer HAL was portrayed as a "cold-hearted killer", by 2009 the public were far more familiar with AI, and the film's GERTY is "the quiet savior" who enables the protagonists to succeed, and who sacrifices itself for their safety.
