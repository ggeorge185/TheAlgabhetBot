Information can take the form of images, sound, video or other multimedia. Bits of information can be streamed via signals. Its Data processing|processing is the central notion of informatics, the European view on computing, which studies information processing algorithms independently of the type of information carrier â€“ whether it is electrical, mechanical or biological. This field plays important role in information theory, telecommunications, information engineering (field)|information engineering and has applications in medical image computing and speech synthesis, among others. ''What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?'' is one of List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problems in theoretical computer science.
