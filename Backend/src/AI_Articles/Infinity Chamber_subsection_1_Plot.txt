A man named Frank, who apparently sabotaged a government operation with a computer virus, is held in a futuristic automated detention facility that is overseen by an artificial intelligence (AI) computer named Howard. Frank tries to escape and, due to the manipulation of his memories by the facility, relives recurrent dreams, mainly in a coffee shop with the owner Gabby, imagining that he has succeeded in escaping the facility, only to later realize that he has not.

Eventually Howard assists with Frank's escape, after realizing that he is breaking down and will eventually not be able to keep Frank alive anyway. Exiting out of the underground prison into a snow-covered wasteland, he is eventually rescued by two hikers. Frank learns that he was trapped in a black site and abandoned by the previous government and he is the only survivor, and various news organizations cover his escape.
