 |ShortSummary=In the Sarlex province, underground mines are used to produce a material needed for industrial purposes. Since humans cannot tolerate the radiation for long, robots were built to do the mining. The robots improved themselves until they were virtually indistinguishable from humans, with human-like appearance, behavior, a sense of humor, and aspirations. However, they are still a subject people, and the Imar authority and the zone troopers can perform "memory audits" to discover information needed for investigations. The Sarlex android people protest it as a violation of their rights. When the Sterling family arrives in this province, problems and a struggle for freedom ensue.

 |ShortSummary=One region of the planet of Thel exhibits the odd phenomena of laser storms: laser bolts shooting from the clouds just like falling rain. These laser storms, in fact, guard an island that appears to be a luxurious resort, but actually is a scientific research facility that has been built upon the former site of an old military experiments base. Now, at this new resort, doctors are researching the attainment of Immortality in fiction|immortality. Their research, however, exacts an extreme price from the resort's guests.  Adding to the Sterling family's trouble is a seductive, young resort official with an overpowering amorous interest...in Hal!

 |ShortSummary=In the Centrex province, Trace and Gina introduce rock 'n' roll music, and record songs written by the Beatles and other classic artists.  The music has an emotional impact that takes the province by storm; creating fans and foes. The Church of Artificial Intelligence - intolerant towards any dissenting ideologies - angrily protests the idol worship of Trace and Gina, whom the church views as subversives undermining their control, and sends both their officials and the Zone Troopers. Cmdr. Kroll is sent to deal with the problem, and he ''likes'' the music! – then he recognizes the two singers.

 |ShortSummary=This episode features a province where "Women's liberation movement|Women's lib" is taken to extremes and men are second-class citizens. Angered by Hal's independent presumption at speaking within her abode and thus suspicious of the Sterling family, the neighborhood "block warden" pokes around the apartment she rented to the Sterling's and finds Kroll's access crystal.  When word gets to Imar, Nuveen Kroll comes, but his authoritative and chauvinistic attitudes get him into trouble! Hal Sterling is dumbfounded when a local employment office routinely gives him increasingly "advanced" yet very simple reading assignments, and is shockingly amazed at how intelligent he is in being capable of ''reading!''  Hal is then issued a job selling "Vorpleware".  When June and Smith go to the supermarket, they find that the automatic IR door sensor forbids entry by females but only admits males.  Men in this zone are forcibly and stringently relegated to all manner of societal chores and duties that - in the Sterling's world - are expected of women.  However, men are expected to do these things to the point of being meek and facing severe discipline.  Also, meat purchased from the supermarket has no different varieties, such as pork, veal, steak, chicken or even a species of fish - it all comes in a drab gray can and looks like drab gray pulp. Finally, Trace gets into trouble by baring his naked upper torso on a hot day while preparing a barbecue grill out in public. (This is his second offense – first was walking into a school gymnasium area reserved only for women.) He is arrested and, like Kroll, is placed on the province's male slave public auction block.  A kindly married couple saves Trace from an obnoxious buyer by buying him publicly and secretly releasing him back to his family.  The couple remarks that they remember a time when relations between men and women used to be different.  This could be a memory of a time in Thel's history, perhaps before the Unification Wars.  One hilarious point of interest in this episode is watching Nuveen Kroll puff up his chest after he glances at the physiques of the other, more well-built auction slaves.  Thel's (or, at least, this province's) equivalent of Tupperware is "Vorpleware"; the expression, "As snug as a bug in a rug" is also known on Thel. The house they stay in while filming this episode is the Innes House (Hallowell House from Charmed) and most residential filming was done on Carroll Avenue.

 |ShortSummary=The Sterlings pass through lands claimed by a mutated human, a "beast", who lets them go only as long as June stays to be his companion. Hal and the children meet a man who tells them about the "beast"... once his brother, but now mutated by a combination of space exploration and experiments that carried him into areas of knowledge and experience beyond mans's understanding.  The result is that Virago now possesses superior knowledge, super-human powers, telepathy and an inhuman, leonine, beast-like appearance.  Steadily, however, Virago's human personality is diminishing as his powers and mutation increases.  He is also terribly lonely as he doesn't know the way back to his humanity and June's kindness towards an Owl in his forest kindles feeling within him of the love that he lost after mutating.  He once attempted a takeover of Imar and was banished to the outer forest regions where the Sterling's encounter him. The planet Thel exhibits yet another odd phenomenon: a falling piece of glowing space rock which can be forged into a mystically-powered substance capable of destroying the beast.  Guest stars Alan Feinstein (actor)|Alan Feinstein as Virago and John Astin as Akin.

 |ShortSummary=In the final episode aired, Gina is believed to be the long-lost princess Metra in a province where one of the royal household's icons is a 200-year-old John F. Kennedy half-dollar. Gina accepts the post, and the Sterling family discovers a group of power-holders who don't want to give up their control, as well as "rebels" who are sick of being controlled. After stopping a potentially murderous coup, the Sterlings introduce the principles of democracy to the province. The Kennedy half-dollar's age makes the Sterlings wonder what year it will be if they ever get home – time appears to pass at a different rate between the respective universes of Earth and Thel. Guest star: Carolyn Seymour as the Prime Manager.
