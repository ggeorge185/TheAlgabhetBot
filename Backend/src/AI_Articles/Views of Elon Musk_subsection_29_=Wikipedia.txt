In 2019, Musk described the Elon Musk|Wikipedia entry about him as "insane" and complained that it was a "war zone with a zillion edits." In 2020, he encouraged his Twitter followers to "trash" the page, which led to the article being locked.

In April 2022, Musk tweeted: "They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive & has lots of time on their hands!", likely referring to Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard, who at the time was listed on Wikipedia as one of Tesla's two co-founders.

In December 2022, Musk responded to the December 2022 Twitter suspensions Wikipedia entry—once named "Thursday Night Massacre"—by saying, "A two day suspension of maybe 7 accounts for doxxing got an actual Wikipedia page!? Wikipedia is controlled by the MSM [<nowiki/>mainstream media] journalists. Can't trust that site anymore." In response, the Wikimedia Foundation changed a message appealing for donations to "Wikipedia is not for sale… Being a non-profit means there is no danger that someone will buy Wikipedia and turn it into their personal playground", likely referring to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter|Musk's acquisition of Twitter.  In October 2023, Musk criticized Wikipedia as "inherently hierarchical and therefore subject to the biases of higher ranking editors."  In response to the funding appeal from Jimmy Wales advertising that “Wikipedia is not for Sale”, Musk offered $1 billion in funding if Wikipedia changed its name to "Dickipedia".
