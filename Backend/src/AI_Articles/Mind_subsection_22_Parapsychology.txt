Parapsychology is the study of certain types of paranormal phenomena, or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal or not have any scientific basis, such as precognition, telekinesis and telepathy.

The term is based on the Greek :wikt:para-|''para'' ('beside, beyond'), Psyche (psychology)|''psyche'' ('soul, mind'), and ''logos'' ('account, explanation') and was coined by psychologist Max Dessoir in or before 1889. Parapsychology is not accepted among the scientific community as science, as psychic abilities have not been demonstrated to exist. The status of parapsychology as a science has also been disputed, with many scientists regarding the discipline as pseudoscience.
