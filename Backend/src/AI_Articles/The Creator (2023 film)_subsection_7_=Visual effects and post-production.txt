One of the film's most significant elements is the fictional U.S. military space station ''NOMAD'', which was noted for its distinctive visual design and sound effects. Edwards revealed that it took the entirety of the COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to design it, describing it as "a bird of prey and an all-seeing eye in the sky, always looking at everybody. So we kept playing with those two shapes and merging them in a way until it just felt right." Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn, who worked with Edwards on ''Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla'' (2014), provided the ship's sound effects, describing them as "a dance, is probably the nice way to say it, between music and sound, and it's never a fight". The assembly cut of the film, which ran for five hours, did not use any Temp track|temp tracks for the music and just the sound design, which Edwards likened to that of the talkies during the late-1920s. Because of this, it was decided that no music be added to the film throughout the entire editing process in order to get the pacing and story structure right in an efficient manner. Edwards called the experience "super interesting. Part of me thinks that I would do that again, because it puts a lot of pressure on the sound design, but then you're not hiding behind music to save the storytelling."
