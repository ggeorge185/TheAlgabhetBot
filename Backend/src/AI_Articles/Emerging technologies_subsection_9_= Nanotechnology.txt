''Nanotechnology'' (sometimes shortened to ''nanotech'') is the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and Supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular scale. The earliest widespread description of nanotechnology  referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum realm|quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.
