According to ''Quartz (publication)|Quartz'', experts who have reviewed the robot's partially open-source code state that Sophia is best categorized as a chatbot with a face. In response, Ben Goertzel, the former chief scientist for the company that made Sophia, stated he had never suggested that Sophia was close to human-level intelligence.

A Sophia lookalike was portrayed by drag queen Gigi Goode in the "Snatch Game" episode of the RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|twelfth season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' (2020).  Goode won the episode with her character "Maria the Robot", based heavily on Sophia and named after a robot featured in the Fritz Lang film Metropolis (1927 film)|''Metropolis''.

In 2022, Sophia collaborated with Italian artist Andrea Bonaceto. For this project, he created digital portraits of Sophia and her creators, which were then processed by Sophia's neural network to produce a unique output that evolved from Bonaceto’s original artworks. Bonaceto then created a series of NFTs as video loops displaying the evolution of the work, starting with Andrea drawings, morphing into the robot interpretation, and then transitioning back to Andrea’s work. The cornerstone piece of the release “Sophia Instantiation” was auctioned on NFT platform Nifty Gateway for $688,888.
