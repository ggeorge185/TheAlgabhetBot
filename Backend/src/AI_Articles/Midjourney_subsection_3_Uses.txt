Founder David Holz says he sees artists as customers, not competitors of Midjourney. Holz told ''The Register'' that artists use Midjourney for rapid prototyping of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves.

The advertising industry has been quick to embrace AI tools such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, among others. The tools, which enable advertisers to create original content and brainstorm ideas quickly are providing new opportunities, such as "custom ads created for individuals, a new way to create special effects, or even making e-commerce advertising more efficient", according to ''Ad Age''.

Architects have described using the software to generate mood boards for the early stages of projects, as an alternative to searching Google Images.
