In 2003, word n-gram language model|word n-gram model, at the time the best statistical algorithm, was overperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling) by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors. 

In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling, and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep learning|deep neural network-style (featuring many hidden layers) machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling and parsing. This is increasingly important artificial intelligence in healthcare|in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in Electronic health record|electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care or protect patient privacy.

In 2023, [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mK28QA0AAAAJ Gautam Siwach] (a PhD student at University of New Haven) with co-author [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bf_t1m8AAAAJ Dr. Cheryl Li] introduce an inventive approach to augment Human-Cobot Interaction (HCI) through the incorporation of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The research integrates the CoboVox voice recognition system into the Universal Robots|UR3e cobot interface, enabling seamless voice-activated engagement for efficient communication. The methodology involves constructing a comprehensive vocabulary, scrutinizing Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP models, and selecting the most fitting one for practical implementation. The resulting HCI framework facilitates the interpretation of voice commands, empowering even non-expert robot operators to effortlessly program and control Cobot|cobots. This study signifies a notable advancement in the field, emphasizing the transformative role of NLP in bridging the communication gap between humans and collaborative robots.
