Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a pivotal element in the realm of machine learning, resembling the structure and function of the human brain. ANNs have undergone significant advancements, particularly in their ability to model complex systems, handle large data sets, and adapt to various types of applications. Their evolution over the past few decades has been marked by notable methodological developments and a broad range of applications in fields such as image processing, speech recognition, natural language processing, finance, and medicine.
