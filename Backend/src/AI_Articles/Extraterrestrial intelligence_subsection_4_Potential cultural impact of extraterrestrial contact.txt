Main|Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact}}

The potential changes from extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, based on the extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. Some theories suggest that an extraterrestrial civilization could be advanced enough to dispense with biology, living instead inside of advanced computers. However, the absence of any such contact to date means such conjecture is largely speculative.<!--All lead material is supported by sources within the body of the main article.-->
