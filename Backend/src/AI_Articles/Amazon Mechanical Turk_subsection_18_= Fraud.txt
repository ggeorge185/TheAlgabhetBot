The Nation'' magazine reported in 2014 that some Requesters had taken advantage of Workers by having them do the tasks, then rejecting their submissions in order to avoid paying them. Available data indicates that rejections are fairly rare. Workers report having a small minority of their HITs rejected, perhaps as low as 1%. The system paid people a dollar or two to install a Facebook-connected app and answer personal questions. The survey task, as a work for hire, was not used for a demographic or psychological research project as it might have seemed. The purpose was instead to bait the worker to reveal personal information about the worker's identity that was not already collected by Facebook or Mechanical Turk.
