Analogy plays a significant role in problem solving, as well as decision making, argumentation, perception, generalization, memory, creativity, invention, prediction, emotion, explanation, conceptualization and communication. It lies behind basic tasks such as the identification of places, objects and people, for example, in face perception and facial recognition systems. Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter has argued that analogy is "the core of cognition".

An analogy is not a figure of speech but a kind of thought. Specific analogical language uses wikt:exemplar|exemplification, Comparison (grammar)|comparisons, metaphors, similes, allegory|allegories, and parables, but ''not'' metonymy. Phrases like ''and so on'', ''and the like'', ''as if'', and the very word ''like'' also rely on an analogical understanding by the receiver of a message including them. Analogy is important not only in ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language and common sense (where proverbs and idioms give many examples of its application) but also in science, philosophy, law and the humanities. 

The concepts of association (psychology)|association, comparison, correspondence, homology (mathematics)|mathematical and homology (biology)|morphological homology, homomorphism, iconicity, isomorphism, metaphor, resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In cognitive linguistics, the notion of conceptual metaphor may be equivalent to that of analogy. Analogy is also a basis for any comparative arguments as well as experiments whose results are transmitted to objects that have been not under examination (e.g., experiments on rats when results are applied to humans).

Analogy has been studied and discussed since classical antiquity by philosophers, scientists, theologists and lawyers. The last few decades have shown a renewed interest in analogy, most notably in cognitive science.
