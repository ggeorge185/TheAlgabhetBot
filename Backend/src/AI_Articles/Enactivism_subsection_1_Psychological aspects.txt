McGann & others argue that enactivism attempts to mediate between the explanatory role of the coupling between cognitive agent and environment and the traditional emphasis on brain mechanisms found in neuroscience and psychology.  In the interactive approach to social cognition developed by De Jaegher &  others, the dynamics of interactive processes are seen to play significant roles in coordinating interpersonal understanding, processes that in part include what they call #Participatory sense-making|''participatory sense-making''. Recent developments of enactivism in the area of social neuroscience involve the proposal of ''The Interactive Brain Hypothesis'' where social cognition brain mechanisms, even those used in non-interactive situations, are proposed to have interactive origins.
