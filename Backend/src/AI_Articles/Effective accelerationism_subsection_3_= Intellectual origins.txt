While Nick Land is seen as the intellectual originator of the broader accelerationism|accelerationist movement, the precise origin of effective accelerationism remains unclear. The earliest known reference to the movement can be traced back to a May 2022 newsletter published by four Pen name|pseudonymous authors known by the Twitter|X (formerly Twitter) usernames @BasedBeffJezos, @bayeslord, @zestular and @creatine_cycle. @BasedBeffJezos names Elon Musk as "the reason he personally is a techno-optimist."

Effective accelerationism incorporates elements of older Silicon Valley subcultures such as transhumanism and extropianism, which similarly emphasized the value of progress and resisted efforts to restrain the development of technology, as well as the work of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit.

In what has been described by the individual as a "Doxing|doxxing" event, ''Forbes'' disclosed that the @BasedBeffJezos persona is maintained by Guillaume Verdon, a Canadian former X Development|Google quantum computing Quantum engineering|engineer and Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist. The revelation was supported by a voice analysis conducted by the National Center for Media Forensics of the University of Colorado Denver, which further confirmed the match between Jezos and Verdon. The magazine justified its decision to disclose Verdon's identity on the grounds of it being "in the public interest". On 29 December 2023 Guillaume Verdon was interviewed by Lex Fridman on the Lex Fridman Podcast|''Lex Fridman Podcast'' and introduced as the "founder of e/acc (effective accelerationism) movement".
