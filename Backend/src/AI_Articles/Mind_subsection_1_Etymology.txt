The original meaning of Old English '':wikt:gemynd|gemynd'' was the faculty of memory, not of thought in general. Hence ''call to mind'', ''come to mind'', ''keep in mind'', ''to have mind of'', etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland. Old English had other words to express "mind", such as '':wikt:hyge|hyge'' "mind, spirit".

The meaning of "memory" is shared with Old Norse, which has ''Muninn|munr''. The word is originally from a PIE verbal root '''', meaning "to think, remember", whence also Latin'' :wikt:mens#Latin|mens'' "mind", Sanskrit '':wikt:मनस्|'' "mind" and Greek :wikt:μένος|μένος "mind, courage, anger".

The generalization of ''mind'' to include all mental faculties, thought, Volition (psychology)|volition, feeling and memory, gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries.
