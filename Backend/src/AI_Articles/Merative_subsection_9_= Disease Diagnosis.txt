There are many diseases out there but there are also many ways that AI has been used to efficiently and accurately diagnose them. Some of the diseases that are the most notorious are Diabetes, and Cardiovascular disease|Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), which are both in the top ten for causes of death worldwide, and have been the basis behind &nbsp;a lot of the research/testing to help get an accurate diagnosis. Due to such a high mortality rate being associated with these diseases, there have been efforts to integrate various methods in helping get accurate diagnosis.

An article by Jiang, et al. (2017) demonstrated that there are multiple different types of AI techniques that have been used for a variety of different diseases. Some of these techniques discussed by Jiang, et al. include: Support vector machines, neural networks, decision trees, and many more. Each of these techniques are described as having a “training goal” so “classifications agree with the outcomes as much as possible…”. From a review of multiple different papers within the timeframe of 2008–2017, The ability to monitor patients using AI may allow for the communication of information to physicians if possible disease activity may have occurred. A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and also allow for the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans.
