Most ancient cultures, including Ancient Greece, History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China, and Outline of ancient India|Ancient India, lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "" ("to make"), which only applied to  (poetry) and to the  (poet, or "maker") who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''Republic (Plato)|The Republic'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely mimesis|imitates."

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in Western cultures through Christianity, as  Revelation|divine inspiration. A concept similar to that in Christianity existed in Greek culture. For instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods. Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "daemon (classical mythology)|daemon" (Greek) or "Genius (mythology)|genius" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later. From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principles of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation. One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci.
