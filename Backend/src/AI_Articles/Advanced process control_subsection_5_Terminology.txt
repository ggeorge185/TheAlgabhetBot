APC: Advanced process control, including feedforward, decoupling, inferentials, and custom algorithms; usually implies DCS-based.
*ARC: Advanced regulatory control, including adaptive gain, override, logic, fuzzy logic, sequence control, device control, and custom algorithms; usually implies DCS-based. 
*Base-Layer: Includes DCS, SIS, field devices, and other DCS subsystems, such as analyzers, equipment health systems, and PLCs. 
*BPCS: Basic process control system (see "base-layer")
*DCS: Distributed control system, often synonymous with BPCS
*MPO: Manufacturing planning optimization
*MPC: Multivariable Model predictive control
*SIS: Safety instrumented system
*SME: Subject matter expert
