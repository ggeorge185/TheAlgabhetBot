Insects have very little resource to devote to intelligence in the human sense of brain processing power.  The number of neurons in an insect varies by species from one million to as few as ten thousand.  By comparison, humans have 86 billion neurons.  Further, large brains are extremely energy hungry.  Insects must therefore find other methods of developing intelligence such as embodying intelligence in hardware, local sensor-motor connections, and swarm intelligence.  At one time it was hoped that robots would avoid the need for such solutions because of the rapidly increasing processing power and decreasing size of computers according to Moore's law.  However, this process seems to be reaching its limit and insect solutions look increasingly attractive.

Walking rhythms independent of the central nervous system in cockroaches have already been mentioned.  A major breakthrough in flying insectoid robots came by applying the same principles to the wings.  Attempts to control the angle of attack of the wings with a central processor were not successful because a lift to weight ratio greater than unity could not be achieved.  Removing the processor and allowing the wings to rotate passively at the natural frequency of the mechanical system reduced the weight sufficiently to allow controlled insectoid flight for the first time in 2008 with a fly-like robot.  However, the robot was externally powered through an umbilical rather than completely free flight.

Swarms of robots can solve problems that are not possible to solve with the limited processing resource of a single robot.  They are particular useful in exploration tasks.  They can be used to find the shortest route to a destination, and have been proposed to search for gas sources in dangerous environments.  Another proposal is robots that self-assemble into a structure to allow the swarm to cross a gap in the manner of ants.
