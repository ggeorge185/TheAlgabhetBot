In ''Politico''<nowiki/>'s interview with Hill'','' she said that Musk's suggestion that Kherson and Zaporizhzhia be up for negotiation, and that the water supply for Crimea be secured, was "so specific that this clearly is a message from Putin". Musk previously made a similar suggestion at a September event in Aspen, Colorado. Hill told Politico, "Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they're just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin".
