Potential anthropogenic causes of human extinction include Nuclear warfare|global thermonuclear war, deployment of a highly effective Biological agent|biological weapon, an ecological collapse, Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|runaway artificial intelligence, runaway nanotechnology (such as a Gray goo|grey goo scenario), a scientific accident involving a micro black hole or False vacuum decay|vacuum metastability disaster, Human overpopulation|overpopulation and overconsumption|increased consumption pose the risk of resource depletion and a concomitant population crash, population decline by choosing to have fewer children, displacement of naturally evolved humans by a new species produced by genetic engineering or technological augmentation. Natural and external extinction risks include high-fatality-rate pandemic, Supervolcano|supervolcanic Types of volcanic eruptions|eruption, Impact event|asteroid impact, nearby supernova or gamma-ray bursts, extreme solar flare, or alien invasion.

Humans (e.g. ''Homo sapiens sapiens'') as a species may also be considered to have "gone extinct" simply by being replaced with distant descendants whose continued evolution may produce new species or subspecies ''Homo'' or of hominids.

Without intervention by unexpected forces, the stellar evolution of the Sun Future of Earth#Solar evolution|is expected to make Earth uninhabitable, then destroy it. Depending on ultimate fate of the universe|its ultimate fate, the entire universe may eventually become uninhabitable.
