Warp was founded amidst the development of Northern England's "bleep techno" scene, often characterized as the first uniquely British rave style. In addition to its simple synth tones (the eponymous "bleeps"), sub-bass inspired by reggae sound systems, and sparse instrumentation, bleep techno also utilised breakbeat-inspired drum machine patterns.

Warp was opened in 1989 by Steve Beckett and the late Rob Mitchell, who had both gained experience working at Sheffield's FON record shop, alongside record producer Robert Gordon. The first release (WAP1) was by Forgemasters (band)|Forgemasters (produced by Robert Gordon), whose 500 copy pressing of "Track with no Name" was financed by an Enterprise Allowance Scheme|Enterprise Allowance grant and distributed in a borrowed car. It set a trend for the early releases both in terms of sound, and the use of purple sleeves (designed by the Designers Republic). The follow-up was Nightmares on Wax's "Dextrous", which sold around 30,000 copies. This led to greater commercial success; by its fifth release the label had its first Top 20 chart entry with LFO (British band)|LFO and their eponymous single, "LFO", which sold 130,000 copies and peaked at No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1990; by coincidence, that same month another Warp act, Greater Than One|Tricky Disco, reached No. 14 in the UK chart with another eponymous single, "Tricky Disco". The first album released was Sweet Exorcist's ''C.C.E.P.'' in 1991. In the same year Robert Gordon left Warp acrimoniously.
