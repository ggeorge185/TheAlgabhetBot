Sophia has appeared on CBS ''60 Minutes'' with Charlie Rose, ''Good Morning Britain'' with Piers Morgan, and outlets like CNBC, ''Forbes'', Mashable, the ''New York Times'', the ''Wall Street Journal'', the ''Guardian'', and the ''Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon''. Sophia was featured in AUDI's annual report and was featured on the cover of the December 2016 issue of ''ELLE Brasil''. R. Eric Thomas later lampooned Sophia on ''Elle.com''.

Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts. Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as ''60 Minutes''s Charlie Rose. Musk tweeted that Sophia should watch ''The Godfather'' and asked "what's the worst that could happen?"

Business Insider's chief UK editor Jim Edwards interviewed Sophia, and while the answers were "not altogether terrible", he predicted that Sophia was a step towards "conversational artificial intelligence". At the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, a BBC News reporter described talking with Sophia as "a slightly awkward experience".

In May 2018, photographer Giulio Di Sturco did a photo shoot of Sophia which appeared in ''National Geographic''. ''Wired (magazine)|Wired'' reported on the shoot.

In 2019, Sophia participated as a speaker at ''Reflect Festival'', a technology event taking place in, Limassol, Cyprus. On stage, she was interviewed by Stefan van der Fluit and replied to written questions by the participants at the festival.
