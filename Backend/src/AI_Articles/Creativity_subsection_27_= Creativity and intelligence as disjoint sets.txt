In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from three different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge
* they are capable of divergent thinking mediated by the frontal lobe
* they are able to modulate neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in their frontal lobe

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cerebral cortex|cortex that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, mood disorder|mood and substance dependence|addiction disorders, and depression (mood)|depression.

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies, and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes may be responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other default mode network functions.

Similarly, in 2018, Lin and Vartanian proposed a Neuroeconomics|neuroeconomic framework that precisely describes norepinephrine's role in creativity and modulating large-scale brain networks associated with creativity.
