Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical or quantum environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, which allows the agent to adapt its behaviorâ€”in other words, to learn what to do in order to gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent, and Superconducting quantum computing|superconducting circuits. A quantum speedup of the agent's internal decision-making time while a quantum speedup of the learning time in a fully coherent (`quantum') interaction between agent and environment has been experimentally realized in a photonic setup.
