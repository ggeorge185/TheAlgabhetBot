"Playing God" generally refers to someone using their power to make decisions regarding the fate of another's life or many lives.  Theologian Paul Ramsey is noted for saying, "Men ought not to play God before they learn to be men, and after they have learned to be men they will not play God." The religious framework of approach to this phrase refers to said religion's deity having a set plan for mankind, therefore man's hubris may lead to the misuse of technology related to sacred life or nature. Other famous literary texts that allude to a man and God complex include ''Men Like Gods'' by H. G. Wells and ''You Shall Be Gods'' by Erich Fromm. The notion of god-like knowledge or power in humans goes back at least to the story of forbidden fruit in  whose traditional King James Version|English translation includes the words "ye shall be as gods".
