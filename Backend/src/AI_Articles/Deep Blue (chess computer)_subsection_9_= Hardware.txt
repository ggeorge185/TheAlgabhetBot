Deep Blue used custom VLSI chips to parallel computing|parallelize the alpha–beta pruning|alpha–beta search algorithm, an example of symbolic AI. The system derived its playing strength mainly from brute-force search|brute force computing power. It was a massively parallel IBM RS/6000 SP Supercomputer with 30 PowerPC 600#PowerPC 604e|PowerPC 604e processors and 480 custom 600&nbsp;µm CMOS VLSI "chess chips" designed to execute the chess-playing expert system, as well as Field-programmable gate array|FPGAs intended to allow patching of the VLSIs (which ultimately went unused) all housed in two cabinets. The chess chip has four parts: the move generator, the smart-move stack, the evaluation function, and the search control. The move generator is a 8x8 combinational logic circuit, a chess board in miniature. 

Its chess playing program was written in C (programming language)|C and ran under the AIX operating system. It was capable of evaluating 200&nbsp;million positions per second, twice as fast as the 1996 version. 

In 1997, Deep Blue was upgraded again to become the 259th most powerful supercomputer according to the TOP500 list, achieving 11.38 GFLOPS on the LINPACK|parallel high performance LINPACK benchmark.
