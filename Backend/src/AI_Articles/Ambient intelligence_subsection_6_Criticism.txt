The ambient intelligence concept is subject to criticism (e.g. David Wright, Serge Gutwirth, Michael Friedewald, et al., Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence, Springer, Dordrecht, 2008). Ambient intelligence can be immersive, personalized, context-aware, and anticipatory; these characteristics bring up societal, political, and cultural concerns about the loss of privacy. Proponents of AmI argue that applications of ambient intelligence can function without necessarily reducing privacy.

Critics also discuss power concentration in large organizations; a fragmented, decreasingly private society; and Hyperreality|hyper-real environments where the virtual is indistinguishable from the real. Several research groups and communities have investigated the socioeconomic, political and cultural aspects of ambient intelligence.
