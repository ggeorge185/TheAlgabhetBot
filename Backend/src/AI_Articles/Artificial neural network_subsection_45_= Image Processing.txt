In the realm of image processing, ANNs have made significant strides. They are employed in tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and image segmentation. For instance, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been instrumental in handwritten digit recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This demonstrates the ability of ANNs to effectively process and interpret complex visual information, leading to advancements in fields ranging from automated surveillance to medical imaging. These advancements have facilitated the development of more accurate and efficient voice-activated systems, enhancing user interfaces in technology products.
