main|Regeneration (biology)}}

Submersion in a liquid called bacta causes mutilated flesh to regenerate in the ''Star Wars'' universe. According to an in-universe reference book, bacta is a red-hued chemical compound; it must be mixed with a synthetic liquid which mimics bodily fluids. The combined bacterial medium regenerates traumatized flesh and promotes tissue growth. Luke Skywalker was first seen using a bacta tank in ''The Empire Strikes Back''; his father Darth Vader has a similar tank in ''Rogue One''. Clone troopers also use such healing technology in ''The Clone Wars''. Bacta can also be administered in a spray form.
