An agent employing anticipation would try to predict the future state of the environment (weather in this case) and make use of the  predictions in the decision making. For example,

 If the sky is cloudy and the air pressure is low,
   it will probably rain soon
      so take the umbrella with you.
 Otherwise
   leave the umbrella home.

These rules explicitly take into account possible future events.

In 1985, Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen defined an anticipatory system as follows:

:A system containing a predictive model of itself and/or its environment,
:which allows it to change state at an instant in accord
:with the model's predictions pertaining to a later instant.

To some extent, Rosen's definition of anticipation applies to any system incorporating machine learning.  At issue is how much of a system's behaviour should or indeed can be determined by reasoning over dedicated representations, how much by on-line Automated planning and scheduling|planning, and how much must be provided by the system's designers.
