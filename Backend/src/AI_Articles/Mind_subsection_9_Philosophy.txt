Main|Philosophy of mind}}

Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental property|mental properties, consciousness and their relationship to the physical body. The ''mind–body problem'', i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body. José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado writes, "In present popular usage, soul and mind are not clearly differentiated and some people, more or less consciously, still feel that the soul, and perhaps the mind, may enter or leave the body as independent entities."

''Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism'' and ''monism'' are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to Plato, Aristotle and the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century. ''Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Substance dualists'' argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas ''Property dualism|Property dualists'' maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emergentism|emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.

The 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity (i.e. the "mind") cannot be made sense of in terms of Descartes|Cartesian "substances" that bear "properties" at all (whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct, separate kind of substance or not). This is because the nature of subjective, ''qualitative'' experience is incoherent in terms of&nbsp;– or semantically Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable with the concept of&nbsp;– substances that bear properties. This is a fundamentally ontology|ontological argument.

The philosopher of cognitive science Daniel Dennett, for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the "mind", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of "software" running in parallel.<!--find page # or page range for this citation--> Psychologist B.F. Skinner argued that the mind is an explanatory fiction that diverts attention from environmental causes of behavior; he considered the mind a "black box" and thought that mental processes may be better conceived of as forms of covert verbal behavior.

Philosopher David Chalmers has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary.   Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain.

The mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.]]
''Monism'' is the position that mind and body are not physiology|physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities. This view was first advocated in Western Philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century Rationalism|rationalist Baruch Spinoza. According to Spinoza's dual-aspect theory, mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as "Nature" or "God".
* ''Physicalism|Physicalists'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.
* ''idealism (philosophy)|Idealists'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.
* ''neutral monism|Neutral monists'' adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type physicalism|type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism.

Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a ''reductive'' or ''non-reductive physicalist'' position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.<!----Well, you get f** idea. There are billions of refs for this---> Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.<!--eg, Chalmers ref and whatever else you like---->
* ''Reductive physicalists'' assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.
* ''Non-reductive physicalists'' argue that although the brain is all there ''is'' to the mind, the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science.

Continued progress in neuroscience has helped to clarify many of these issues, and its findings have been taken by many to support Physicalism|physicalists' assertions. Nevertheless, our knowledge is incomplete, and modern philosophers of mind continue to discuss how subjective qualia and the intentional stance|intentional mental states can be naturalism (philosophy)|naturally explained. There is also the problem of Quantum mechanics|Quantum Mechanics, whose Copenhagen interpretation can be understood as a form of perspectivism. As the Copenhagen interpretation is not universally accepted, an exact mechanism of the Wave function collapse|collapse of the wavefunction remains elusive, and the role of mind in fundamental physical theory is unclear.
