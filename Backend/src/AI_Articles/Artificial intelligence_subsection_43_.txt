Possible options for limiting AI include: using Embedded Ethics or Constitutional AI where companies or governments can add a policy, restricting high levels of compute power in training, restricting the ability to rewrite its own code base, restrict certain AI techniques but not in the training phase, open-source (transparency) vs proprietary (could be more restricted), backup model with redundancy, restricting security, privacy and copyright, restricting or controlling the memory, real-time monitoring, risk analysis, emergency shut-off, rigorous simulation and testing, model certification, assess known vulnerabilities, restrict the training material, restrict access to the internet, issue terms of use.
