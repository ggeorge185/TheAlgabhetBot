In July 2006, Cycorp released the executable of ResearchCyc 1.0, a version of Cyc aimed at the research community, at no charge. (ResearchCyc was in beta stage of development during all of 2004; a beta version was released in February 2005.) In addition to the taxonomic information contained in OpenCyc, ResearchCyc includes significantly more semantic knowledge (i.e., additional facts and rules of thumb) involving the concepts in its knowledge base; it also includes a large lexicon, English language|English parsing and generation tools, and Java (programming language)|Java-based interfaces for knowledge editing and querying. In addition it contains a system for ontology-based data integration.  As of 2017, regular releases of ResearchCyc continued to appear, with 600 research groups utilizing licenses around the world at no cost for noncommercial research purposes. As of December 2019,  ResearchCyc is no longer supported. Cycorp expects to improve and overhaul tools for external developers over the coming years.
