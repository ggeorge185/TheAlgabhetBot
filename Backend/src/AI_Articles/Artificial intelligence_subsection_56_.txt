Main|Robot rights}}
If a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also ''suffer''; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights. Any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. This issue has been considered in artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction for centuries, and is now being considered by, for example, California's Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.
