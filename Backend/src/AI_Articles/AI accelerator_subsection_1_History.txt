Computer systems have frequently complemented the central processing unit|CPU with special-purpose accelerators for specialized tasks, known as coprocessors. Notable application-specific integrated circuit|application-specific expansion card|hardware units include video cards for computer graphics|graphics, sound cards, graphics processing units and digital signal processors. As deep learning and artificial intelligence workloads rose in prominence in the 2010s, specialized hardware units were developed or adapted from existing products to hardware acceleration|accelerate these tasks. Benchmarks such as MLPerf may be used to evaluate the performance of AI accelerators.
