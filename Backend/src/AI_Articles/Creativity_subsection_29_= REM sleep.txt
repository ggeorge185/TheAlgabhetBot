Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process. Rapid eye movement sleep|REM rather than Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep appears to be responsible. This may be due to changes in cholinergic and Norepinephrine|noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, in which higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. REM sleep may aid creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."

According to Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# It makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association.
# It leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem.
# It increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated.
Together, these processes lead positive affect to improve creativity.

Barbara Fredrickson in her broaden-and-build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope). Day-by-day psychological experiences including emotions, perceptions, and motivation significantly impact creative performance. Creativity is higher when emotions and perceptions are more positive and when intrinsic motivation is stronger.

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas ''et al.'' (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.
