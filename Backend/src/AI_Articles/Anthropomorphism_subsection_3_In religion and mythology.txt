Main|Anthropotheism}}
In religion and mythology, anthropomorphism is the perception of a divine being or beings in human form, or the recognition of human qualities in these beings.

Ancient mythologies frequently represented the divine as deities with human forms and qualities. They resemble human beings not only in appearance and personality; they exhibited many human behaviors that were used to explain natural phenomena, creation, and historical events. The deities fell in love, married, had children, fought battles, wielded weapons, and rode horses and chariots. They feasted on special foods, and sometimes required sacrifices of food, beverage, and sacred objects to be made by human beings. Some anthropomorphic deities represented specific human concepts, such as love, war, fertility, beauty, or the seasons. Anthropomorphic deities exhibited human qualities such as beauty, wisdom, and Power (international relations)|power, and sometimes human weaknesses such as greed, hatred, jealousy, and Anger|uncontrollable anger. Greek deities such as Zeus and Apollo (god)|Apollo often were depicted in human form exhibiting both commendable and despicable human traits. Anthropomorphism in this case is, more specifically, anthropotheism.

From the perspective of adherents to religions in which humans were created in the form of the divine, the phenomenon may be considered theomorphism, or the giving of divine qualities to humans.

Anthropomorphism has cropped up as a Anthropomorphism (heresy)|Christian heresy, particularly prominently with the Audianism|Audians in third century Syria, but also in fourth century Egypt and tenth century Italy.  This often was based on a literal interpretation of Book of Genesis|Genesis 1:27: "So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them".
