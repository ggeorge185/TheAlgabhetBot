In 2002, Daniel Kahneman and Shane Frederick proposed that cognitive heuristics work by a process called ''attribute substitution'', which happens without conscious awareness. According to this theory, when somebody makes a judgement (of a "target attribute") that is computationally complex, a more easily calculated "heuristic attribute" is substituted. In effect, a cognitively difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem, without being aware of this happening. Heuristics can be considered to reduce the complexity of clinical judgments in health care.
