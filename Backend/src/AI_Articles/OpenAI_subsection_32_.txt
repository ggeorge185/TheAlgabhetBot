In pop culture, initial applications of this tool were used as early as 2020 for the internet psychological thriller Ben Drowned to create music for the titular character.

Released in 2020, Jukebox is an open-sourced algorithm to computer music|generate music with vocals. After training on 1.2&nbsp;million samples, the system accepts a genre, artist, and a snippet of lyrics and outputs song samples. OpenAI stated the songs "show local musical coherence [and] follow traditional chord patterns" but acknowledged that the songs lack "familiar larger musical structures such as choruses that repeat" and that "there is a significant gap" between Jukebox and human-generated music. ''The Verge'' stated "It's technologically impressive, even if the results sound like mushy versions of songs that might feel familiar", while ''Business Insider'' stated "surprisingly, some of the resulting songs are catchy and sound legitimate".
