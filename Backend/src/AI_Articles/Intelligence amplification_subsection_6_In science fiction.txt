Augmented intelligence has been a repeating theme in science fiction. A positive view of brain implants used to communicate with a computer as a form of augmented intelligence is seen in Algis Budrys 1976 novel ''Michaelmas (novel)|Michaelmas''. Fear that the technology will be misused by the government and military is an early theme. In the 1981 BBC serial ''The Nightmare Man (TV series)|The Nightmare Man'' the pilot of a high-tech mini submarine is linked to his craft via a brain implant but becomes a savage killer after ripping out the implant.

Perhaps the most well known writer exploring themes of intelligence augmentation is William Gibson, in work such as his 1981 story "Johnny Mnemonic", in which the title character has computer-augmented memory, and his 1984 novel ''Neuromancer'', in which computer hackers interface through brain-computer interfaces to computer systems. Vernor Vinge, as discussed earlier, looked at intelligence augmentation as a possible route to the technological singularity, a theme which also appears in his fiction.

''Flowers for Algernon'' is an early example of augmented intelligence in science fiction literature. First published as a short story in 1959, the plot concerns an Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled man who undergoes an experiment to increase his intelligence to genius levels. His rise and fall is detailed in his journal entries, which become more sophisticated as his intelligence increases.
