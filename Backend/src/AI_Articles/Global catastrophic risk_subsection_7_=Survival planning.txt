Some scholars propose the establishment on Earth of one or more self-sufficient, remote, permanently occupied settlements specifically created for the purpose of surviving a global disaster.

Food storage has been proposed globally, but the monetary cost would be high. Furthermore, it would likely contribute to the current millions of deaths per year due to malnutrition. In 2022, a team led by David Denkenberger modeled the cost-effectiveness of resilient foods to AI alignment|artificial general intelligence (AGI) safety and found "~98-99% confidence" for a higher marginal impact of work on resilient foods. Some survivalists stock Retreat (survivalism)|survival retreats with multiple-year food supplies.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is buried  inside a mountain on an island in the Arctic. It is designed to hold 2.5&nbsp;billion seeds from more than 100 countries as a precaution to preserve the world's crops. The surrounding rock is  (as of 2015) but the vault is kept at  by refrigerators powered by locally sourced coal.

More speculatively, if society continues to function and if the biosphere remains habitable, calorie needs for the present human population might in theory be met during an extended absence of sunlight, given sufficient advance planning. Conjectured solutions include growing mushrooms on the dead plant biomass left in the wake of the catastrophe, converting cellulose to sugar, or feeding natural gas to methane-digesting bacteria.
