The earliest known use of the term ''business intelligence'' is in Richard Millar Devens' ''Cyclop√¶dia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes'' (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker Sir Henry Furnese, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Furnese gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:


The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.

When Hans Peter Luhn, a researcher at IBM, used the term ''business intelligence'' in an article published in 1958, he employed the ''Webster's Dictionary'' definition of intelligence: "the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal." 

In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a Gartner analyst) proposed ''business intelligence'' as an umbrella term to describe "concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems." It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.
