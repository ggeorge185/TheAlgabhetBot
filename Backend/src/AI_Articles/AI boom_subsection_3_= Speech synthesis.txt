15.ai was one of the first publicly available speech synthesis software that allowed people to generate natural emotive high-fidelity text-to-speech voices from an assortment of fictional characters from a variety of media sources. It was first released in March 2020. ElevenLabs unveiled a website where users are able to upload voice samples to that allowed it to generate voices from them. The company was criticized after users were able to abuse its software to generate controversial statements in the vocal style of celebrities, public officials, and other famous individuals and raised concerns that it could be used to generate deepfakes that were more convincing. An unofficial song created using the voices of musicians Drake (musician)|Drake and The Weeknd in speech synthesis software raised questions about the ethics and legality of similar software.
