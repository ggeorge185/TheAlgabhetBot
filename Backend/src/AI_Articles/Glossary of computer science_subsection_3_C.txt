 to other code that is expected to "call back" (execute) the argument at a given time. This execution may be immediate, as in a ''synchronous callback'', or it might happen at a later time, as in an ''asynchronous callback''.}}


 that carries out the  of a  by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and  (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a ''processor'', more specifically to its processing unit and  (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.}}

, an extensible program-code-template for creating Object (object-oriented programming)|objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or Method (computer programming)|methods).}} In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor of the class (a  that creates objects), and as the data type|type of objects generated by Instance (computer science)|instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.}}}}



 (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining "" of , instead of via the objects alone (compare prototype-based programming).}}


 that accesses a service made available by a Server (computing)|server. The server is often (but not always) on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a Computer network|network. The term applies to the role that programs or devices play in the client–server model.}}

, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, Code reuse|pre-written code and , ,  or  specifications. In OS/360 and successors|IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as Partitioned dataset|partitioned data sets.}}


  for accomplishing a specific  task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating , profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen  (commonly referred to as '''coding'''). The  of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the , specialized algorithms, and formal logic.}}


, , error detection and correction, data transmission and data storage. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines—such as information theory, electrical engineering, mathematics, linguistics, and —for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction or detection of errors in the transmitted data.}}








.  Each record consists of one or more , separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.}}


 that transforms computer code written in one  (the source language) into another programming language (the target language). Compilers are a type of Translator (computing)|translator that support digital devices, primarily computers. The name ''compiler'' is primarily used for programs that translate  from a high-level programming language to a Low-level programming language|lower-level language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an  program.}}


, and of the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, recursion theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.}}


. The study of computation is paramount to the discipline of .}}





, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids.}}


 which focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an .}}


 that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation.}}
















. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called . These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.}}


 systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.}}

 which performs different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean data type|Boolean condition evaluates to true or false. Apart from the case of branch predication, this is always achieved by selectively altering the  based on some condition.}}





 in which  is passed explicitly in the form of a continuation. This is contrasted with direct style, which is the usual style of programming. Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy L. Steele, Jr. coined the phrase in AI Memo 349 (1975), which sets out the first version of the Scheme (programming language)|Scheme programming language.}}
