The Quantum AI Lab was announced by Google Research in a blog post on May 16, 2013. At the time of launch, the Lab was using the most advanced commercially available quantum computer, D-Wave Two from D-Wave Systems.

On October 18, 2013, Google announced that it had incorporated quantum physics into ''Minecraft''.

In January 2014, Google reported results comparing the performance of the D-Wave Two in the lab with that of classical computers. The results were ambiguous and provoked heated discussion on the Internet.
On 2 September 2014, it was announced that the Quantum AI Lab, in partnership with UC Santa Barbara, would be launching an initiative to create quantum information processors based on superconducting electronics.

On the 23rd of October 2019, the Quantum AI Lab announced in a paper that it had achieved quantum supremacy.
