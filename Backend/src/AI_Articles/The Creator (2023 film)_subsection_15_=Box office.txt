As of|2023|11|19|df=US}}, ''The Creator'' has grossed $40.8&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada, and $63.2&nbsp;million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $104&nbsp;million. The film made $6.1 million and $4.3 million in its second and third weekend, finishing fifth both times.

Prior to its release, Cindy White of ''The A.V. Club'' cited the mid-teen estimates were due to it being an original film (not based on an existing Intellectual property|IP), cast and filmmakers not being entirely household names (save for Washington and Janney), poor timing of the release in the midst of Regulation of artificial intelligence|societal and governmental issues regarding generative AI's place in everyday life, and lackluster marketing and promotion due in-part to the ongoing 2023 2023 Writers Guild of America strike|WGA and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike|SAG-AFTRA strikes. Ben Sherlock of ''Screen Rant'' thought being released in the midst of public debates over AI was a positive for the film rather than a negative and attributed the poor performance to its Rotten Tomatoes score and the price of cinema tickets. Following its $14 million opening weekend, Richard Lawson of ''Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair'' expressed hope that the film could become a sleeper hit given its healthier performance overseas, saying: "The film's plotting may be derivative, its twists and emotional beats predictable. But there is still something rare and special in its execution; it's Denis Villeneuve without the cold fussiness, the lacquered preening. Now that Edwards is free of ''Star Wars'' (though his ''Star Wars'' movie is a good one), he is a filmmaker to be fostered and encouraged, so that he might make ever more arresting entertainments like ''The Creator''."
