According to research experts interviewed by ''Business Insider'' in April 2023, Fridman "lacks the publications, citations and conference appearances required to be taken seriously in the hypercompetitive world of academia".

Ben Samuel argued in a 2023 article in ''Haaretz'' that Fridman failed to challenge claims made on his podcast by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

A 2023 article by Elizabeth Lopatto in ''The Verge'' stated that Fridman's podcast "has a following among the tech elite" and said that Fridman "is a softball interviewer" (someone who does not ask confrontational or probing questions of interviewees).
