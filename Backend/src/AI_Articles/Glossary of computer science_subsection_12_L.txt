An instance of a list is a computer representation of the mathematical concept of a finite sequence (mathematics)|sequence; the (potentially) infinite analog of a list is a . Lists are a basic example of , as they contain other values. If the same value occurs multiple times, each occurrence is considered a distinct item.}}
