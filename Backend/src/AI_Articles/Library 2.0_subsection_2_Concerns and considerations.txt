Some concerns about Library 2.0 relate to access to technology, privacy

Another concern is that the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies can allow users to spread hate speech and cyberbullying in the library system.  It is suggested that librarians define hate speech in their user content policies and identify it when it occurs.

When using social networking through Facebook in a Swedish public library, librarians were described as 'always at the beck and call of Facebook', and capable of losing the relationships they'd built with their clients over the site due to glitches in Facebook.
