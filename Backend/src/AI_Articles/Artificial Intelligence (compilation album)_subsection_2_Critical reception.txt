In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic John Bush praised ''Artificial Intelligence'' as "a superb collection of electronic listening music." The following year, Tegan O'Neil of ''The A.V. Club'' wrote: "Although every producer on it would go on to have a long and storied career, the album's music is satisfying enough on its own terms."
