Academics and observers expressed concerns about the validity and soundness of the AI Cold War narrative.
Denise Garzia expressed concern in Nature (journal)|''Nature'' that the AI Cold War narrative will undermine the efforts by the US to establish global rules for AI ethics.
Researchers have warned in ''MIT Technology Review'' that the breakdown in international collaboration in the area of science because of the threat of the alleged AI Cold War would be detrimental to progress. Additionally, the AI Cold War narrative impacts on many more areas including the planning of supply chains and the proliferation of AI. The dissemination of the AI Cold War narrative could therefore be costly and destructive and exacerbate existing tensions. 
The AI Cold War started as a narrative but it could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy and fuel an arms race, not only because of corporate interests but also because of the existing interests at different national security departments.

Regarding cyber power, the International Institute for Strategic Studies published a study in June 2021, which argued that the online capabilities of China have been exaggerated and that Chinese cyber power is at least a decade behind the US, largely due to lingering security issues.
