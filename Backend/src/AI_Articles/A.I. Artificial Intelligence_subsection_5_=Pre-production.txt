In early 1994, the film was in pre-production with Chris Baker (artist)|Christopher "Fangorn" Baker as concept artist, and Sara Maitland assisting on the story, which gave it "a feminist fairy-tale focus". Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as ''A.I.'', but as ''Pinocchio''. Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for ''A.I.'' can be seen on the DVD, ''Directors Label|The Work of Director Chris Cunningham''. Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role. The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to ''Eyes Wide Shut'' (1999). By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' (1977). Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000, because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', ''Minority Report (film)|Minority Report'' and ''Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha''. The following month Spielberg announced that ''A.I.'' would be his next project, with ''Minority Report'' as a follow-up. When he decided to fast track ''A.I.'', Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist.
