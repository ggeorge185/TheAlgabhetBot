A simple example of concepts modeled in a frame language is the FOAF (ontology)|Friend of A Friend (FOAF) ontology defined as part of the Semantic Web as a foundation for social networking and calendar systems. The primary frame in this simple example is a ''Person''. Example slots are the person's ''email'', ''home page, phone,'' etc. The interests of each person can be represented by additional frames describing the space of business and entertainment domains. The slot ''knows'' links each person with other persons. Default values for a person's interests can be inferred by the web of people they are friends of.
