During his bachelor studies, he spent time at NVIDIA during the pre deep learning era (2008).
His PhD was divided between Google Brain where he spent a year, and Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research where he spent another year.

During his stay at Google, he co-authored work on adversarial examples for neural networks. This result created the field of adversarial attacks on neural networks.

His PhD is focused on matching capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic power of programmable computers.
