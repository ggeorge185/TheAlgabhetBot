In the 1960s, statisticians and economists used terms like ''data fishing'' or ''data dredging'' to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an A priori probability|a-priori hypothesis. The term "data mining" was used in a similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in the ''Review of Economic Studies'' in 1983. Lovell indicates that the practice "masquerades under a variety of aliases, ranging from "experimentation" (positive) to "fishing" or "snooping" (negative).

The term ''data mining'' appeared around 1990 in the database community, with generally positive connotations. For a short time in 1980s, the phrase "database mining"â„¢, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego-based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation; researchers consequently turned to ''data mining''. Other terms used include ''data archaeology'', ''information harvesting'', ''information discovery'', ''knowledge extraction'', etc. Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro|Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro coined the term "knowledge discovery in databases" for the first workshop on the same topic [http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/kdd89/ (KDD-1989)] and this term became more popular in the Artificial intelligence|AI and machine learning communities. However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities. Currently, the terms ''data mining'' and ''knowledge discovery'' are used interchangeably.
