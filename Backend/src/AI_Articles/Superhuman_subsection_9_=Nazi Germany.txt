Further|master race|Nazism}}
The Nietzschean notion of bettering one's self as an individual was expanded within the philosophy of Nazism to apply to whole groups and nations. Nazi racialist thinkers proposed perfecting the Aryan race through controlled breeding and coercive eugenics (including the Aktion T4|murder of those deemed unfit) as a way of improving their racial stock and purifying their society. They intended to create a ''herrenvolk'' (race of masters) wherein the Germanic "Ãœbermenschen" would rule over so-called inferior "untermenschen" such as Slavs and West Asians.
