Main|Intelligence and public policy}}

In the United States, certain Public policy (law)|public policies and laws regarding military service, education, public benefits, capital punishment,}} and employment incorporate an individual's IQ into their decisions. However, in the case of ''Griggs v. Duke Power Co.'' in 1971, for the purpose of minimizing employment practices that disparately impacted racial minorities, the Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court banned the use of IQ tests in employment, except when linked to job performance via a job analysis. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting neurotoxins, have as one of their goals raising, or preventing a decline in, intelligence.

A diagnosis of intellectual disability is in part based on the results of IQ testing. Borderline intellectual functioning is the categorization of individuals of below-average cognitive ability (an IQ of 71â€“85), although not as low as those with an intellectual disability (70 or below).

In the United Kingdom, the eleven plus exam which incorporated an intelligence test has been used from 1945 to decide, at eleven years of age, which type of school a child should go to. They have been much less used since the widespread introduction of comprehensive schools.
