Industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing, quality control, and material handling processes. General-purpose controllers for industrial processes include programmable logic controllers, Stand-alone power system|stand-alone I/O modules, and computers. Industrial automation is to replace the human action and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands. One trend is increased use of machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions, another is a continuing increase in the use of robots. Industrial automation is simply required in industries.

Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency in industrial processes has become a higher priority. Semiconductor companies like Infineon Technologies are offering 8-bit computing|8-bit Microcontroller|micro-controller applications for example found in Motor controller|motor controls, General purpose technology|general purpose pumps, fans, and ebikes to reduce energy consumption and thus increase efficiency.
