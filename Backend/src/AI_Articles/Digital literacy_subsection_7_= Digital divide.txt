main|Digital divide}}
Digital divide refers to disparities (such as those living in the developed vs the developing world) concerning access to and the use of Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies (ICT), such as computer hardware, software, and the Internet, among people. Individuals within societies that lack economic resources to build ICT infrastructure do not have adequate digital literacy, which means that their digital skills are limited. The divide can be explained by Max Weber's Three-component theory of stratification|social stratification theory, which focuses on access to production, rather than ownership of the capital. Production means having access to ICT so that an individual can interact and produce information or create a product, without which, he or she cannot participate in learning, collaboration, and production processes. In an article by Jen Schradie called, ''The Great Class Wedge and the Internet's Hidden Costs,'' she discusses how social class can affect digital literacy. Young people report being connected to the internet at rates of 94-98%. The digital divide is also defined as emphasizing the distinction between the “haves” and “have-nots,” and presents all data separately for rural, urban, and central-city categories. Also, existing research on the digital divide reveals the existence of personal categorical inequalities between young and old people. An additional interpretation identified the gap between technology accessed by youth outside and inside the classroom.
