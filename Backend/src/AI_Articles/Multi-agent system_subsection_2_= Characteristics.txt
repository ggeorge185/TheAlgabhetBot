The agents in a multi-agent system have several important characteristics:

* Autonomy: agents at least partially independent, self-aware, Autonomous agent|autonomous
* Local views: no agent has a full global view, or the system is too complex for an agent to exploit such knowledge
* Decentralization: no agent is designated as controlling (or the system is effectively reduced to a monolithic system)
