Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping traditional literature review across various disciplines. Generative pre-trained transformers, such as ChatGPT, are often used by students and academics for review purposes. 

Nevertheless, the employment of ChatGPT in academic reviews is problematic due to ChatGPT's propensity to "Hallucination (artificial intelligence)|hallucinate". In response, efforts are being made to mitigate these hallucinations through the integration of plugins. For instance, Rad et al. (2023) used ScholarAI for review in cardiothoracic surgery.
