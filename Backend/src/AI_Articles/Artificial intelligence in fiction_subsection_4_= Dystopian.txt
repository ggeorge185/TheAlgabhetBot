The researcher Duncan Lucas writes (in 2002) that humans are worried about the technology they are constructing, and that as machines started to approach intellect and thought, that concern becomes acute. He calls the early 20th century dystopian view of AI in fiction the "animated automaton", naming as examples the 1931 film ''Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein'', the 1927 ''Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis'', and the 1920 play ''R.U.R.'' A later 20th century approach he names "heuristic hardware", giving as instances ''2001 a Space Odyssey'', ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'', ''The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', and ''I, Robot''. Lucas considers also the films that illustrate the effect of the personal computer on science fiction from 1980 onwards with the blurring of the boundary between the real and the virtual, in what he calls the "cyborg effect". He cites as examples ''Neuromancer'', ''The Matrix'', ''The Diamond Age'', and ''Terminator (franchise)|Terminator''.

The film director Ridley Scott has focused on AI throughout his career, and it plays an important part in his films ''Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus'', ''Blade Runner'', and #AI in service to society|the ''Alien'' franchise.
