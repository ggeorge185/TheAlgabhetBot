The foundation of most artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in industrial settings are comprehensive datasets from the respective fields. Those datasets act as the basis for training the employed models. arxiv:2111.09344|The People's Speech) and data scraped from the open internet are frequently used for this purpose. Such datasets rarely exist in the industrial context because of high confidentiality requirements <ref name=":3" /> and high specificity of the data. Industrial applications of artificial intelligence are therefore often faced with the problem of data availability.<ref name=":3" />

For these reasons, existing open datasets applicable to industrial applications, often originate from public institutions like governmental agencies or universities  and data analysis competitions hosted by companies. In addition to this, data sharing platforms exist. However, most of these platforms have no industrial focus and offer limited filtering abilities regarding industrial data sources.
