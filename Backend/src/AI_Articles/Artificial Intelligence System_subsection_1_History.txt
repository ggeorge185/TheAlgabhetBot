The project's initial goal was recreating the largest brain simulation to date, performed by neuroscientist Eugene M. Izhikevich of The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego, California. Izhikevich simulated 1 second of activity of 100 billion neurons (the estimated number of neurons in the human brain) in 50 days using a Cluster (computing)|cluster of 27 3-gigahertz processors.  He extrapolated that a real-time simulation of the brain could not be achieved before 2016.  The project aimed to disprove this prediction.

Artificial Intelligence System announced on On Sep 5, 2007 that they will use the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software to perform intensive calculations.

On July 12, 2008, the first phase of the project had been completed by reaching the 100 billion neuron mark. The project then continued to simulate neurons while they completed the development of other related applications.
