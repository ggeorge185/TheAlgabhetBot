A DMP is any kind of software that manages the gathering, storage, and organization of data so that useful information can be leveraged from it by marketers, publishers, and other businesses. The data stored may include customer information, Demography|demographics, and mobile identifiers or HTTP cookie|cookie IDs, which the DMP will analyze to allow businesses to create targeting segments for advertisements. DMPs can help brands learn more about their customer segments to inform acquisitions strategies and increase their sales. They also allow businesses to gauge the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.
