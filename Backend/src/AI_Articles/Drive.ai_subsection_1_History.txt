Drive.ai was established in 2015 through Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Lab by a group of masters and PhD students from Andrew Ng's research lab. The group initially worked to develop a retrofit kit to add their autonomous driving system to existing cars. In August 2016, the company emerged from stealth mode with $12 million in funding and became the 13th company in California to get a license to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. The company's early funding included investments by Northern Light Venture Capital, Oriza Ventures and InnoSpring Seed Fund.

In June 2017, Drive.ai raised a $50 million Series B funding round led by New Enterprise Associates with participation from GGV Capital, Northern Light Venture Capital and other previous investors. As part of the funding announcement, the company also announced that scientist Andrew Ng had joined its board of directors.<Ref></ref> In the same month, Lyft announced a partnership with Drive.ai to run a pilot program in San Francisco operating Drive.ai's test fleet through Lyft's platform.

Drive.ai raised an additional $15 million in September 2017 including participation from Grab (company)|Grab, a ride-hailing technology company in Southeast Asia.

In May 2018, it was announced that Drive.ai was working with the Frisco Transportation Management Association and would be releasing an on-demand self-driving passenger carrying car service in Frisco, Texas during the course of an initial 6-month pilot program. It was the first public deployment of self-driving cars in Texas. The pilot program will initially use safety drivers to monitor the car's operation, but will eventually move to driverless operation with remote monitoring. A Drive.ai app will be used by riders to call rides. Initially, the program will operate as a shared service within a fixed area including retail, entertainment and office spaces using designated pickup and drop-off locations. During the trial period, Drive.ai offered public education about its self-driving technology.

In October 2018, Drive.ai announced that it would launch a similar self-driving passenger carrying car service in Arlington, Texas and became the first company with revenue in the self-driving car space. The service would include three vehicles running on several routes across different parts of the city, including the AT&T Stadium.
