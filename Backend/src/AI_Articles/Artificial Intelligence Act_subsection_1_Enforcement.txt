The Act regulates the entry to the European single market|EU internal market. To this extent it uses the New Legislative Framework, which can be traced back to the New Approach which dates back to 1985. How this works is as follows: The EU legislator creates the AI-act, this Act contains the most important provisions that all AI-systems that want access to the EU internal market will have to comply with. These requirements are called 'essential requirements'. Under the New Legislative Framework, these essential requirements are passed on to European Standardisation Organisations who draw up technical standards that further specify the essential requirements.

As mentioned above, the Act requires that member states set up their own notifying bodies. Conformity assessments should take place in order to check whether AI-systems indeed conform to the standards as set out in the AI-Act. This conformity assessment is either done by self-assessment, which means that the provider of the AI-system checks for conformity themselves, or this is done through third party conformity assessment which means that the notifying body will carry out the assessment. Notifying bodies do retain the possibility to carry out audits to check whether conformity assessment is carried out properly.

Under the current proposal it seems to be the case that many high-risk AI-systems do not require third party conformity assessment which is critiqued by some. These critiques are based on the fact that high-risk AI-systems should be assessed by an independent third party to fully secure its safety.
