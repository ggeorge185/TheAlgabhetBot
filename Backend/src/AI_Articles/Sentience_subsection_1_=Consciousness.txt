According to Thomas Nagel in his paper "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?", ''consciousness'' can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective perceptual experiences, or as some philosophers refer to them, "qualia"â€”in other words, the ability to have states that it ''feels like something'' to be in. Some philosophers, notably Colin McGinn, believe that the physical process causing consciousness to happen will never be understood, a position known as "new mysterianism." They do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that qualia will never be explained. Other philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, argue that qualia are not a meaningful concept.

Regarding animal consciousness, according to the Animal consciousness|Cambridge Declaration of Consciousness, which was publicly proclaimed on 7 July 2012 at Cambridge University, consciousness is that which requires specialized Nervous system|neural structures, chiefly neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates, which manifests in more complex organisms as the central nervous system, to exhibit consciousness. Accordingly, only organisms that possess these substrates, all within the Kingdom Animalia|animal kingdom, are said to be conscious.
