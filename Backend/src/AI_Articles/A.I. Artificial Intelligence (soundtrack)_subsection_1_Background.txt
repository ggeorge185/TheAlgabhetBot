The album was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score (ceding to the score of ''Music of The Lord of the Rings film series#The Fellowship of the Ring|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring''), the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score (ceding to the score of ''Moulin Rouge! (soundtrack)|Moulin Rouge!'') and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media (ceding to the score of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (soundtrack)|Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'').

The 2001 official soundtrack album did not include all of the music from the film, and several cues were conspicuously absent. A promotion-only release of the complete soundtrack was created for members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that were responsible for voting for the award for Best Original Score. This version of the soundtrack later leaked to the public, and has been issued in several bootleg editions by various record labels.  Then, in 2015, the complete score was officially issued for the first time in a 3-CD set by La-La Land Records.
