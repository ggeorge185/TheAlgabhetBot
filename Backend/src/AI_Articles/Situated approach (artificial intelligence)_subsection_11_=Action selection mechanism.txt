The situated AI community has presented several solutions to modeling decision-making processes, also known as action selection mechanisms. The first attempt to solve this problem goes back to ''subsumption architectures'', which were in fact more an implementation technique than an algorithm. However, this attempt paved the way to several others, in particular the ''free-flow hierarchies'' and ''activation networks''. A comparison of the structure and performances of these two mechanisms demonstrated the advantage of using ''free-flow hierarchies'' in solving the action selection problem. However, ''motor schemas'' and ''process description languages'' are two other approaches that have been used with success for autonomous robots.
