Evolutionary computation can be seen as a family of methods and algorithms for global optimization, which are usually based on a Population model (evolutionary algorithm)|population of candidate solutions. They are inspired by biological evolution and are often summarized as evolutionary algorithms. These include the genetic algorithms, evolution strategy, genetic programming and many others. They are considered as problem solvers for tasks not solvable by traditional mathematical methods and are frequently used for Optimization (computer science)|optimization including multi-objective optimization.
