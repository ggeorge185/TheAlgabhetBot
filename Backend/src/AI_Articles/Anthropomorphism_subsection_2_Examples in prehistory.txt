From the beginnings of human behavioral modernity in the Upper Paleolithic, about 40,000 years ago, examples of Zoomorphism|zoomorphic (animal-shaped) works of art occur that may represent the earliest known evidence of anthropomorphism. One of the oldest known is an ivory sculpture, the Lion-man|Löwenmensch figurine, Germany, a human-shaped figurine with the head of a lioness or lion, determined to be about 32,000 years old.

It is not possible to say what these prehistoric artworks represent. A more recent example is The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer, an enigmatic cave painting from the Trois Frères|Trois-Frères Cave, Ariège, France: the figure's significance is unknown, but it is usually interpreted as some kind of great spirit or master of the animals. In either case there is an element of anthropomorphism.

This anthropomorphic art has been linked by archaeologist Steven Mithen with the emergence of more systematic hunting practices in the Upper Palaeolithic. He proposes that these are the product of a change in the Modularity of mind|architecture of the human mind, , where anthropomorphism allowed hunters to identify Empathy|empathetically with hunted animals and better predict their movements.
