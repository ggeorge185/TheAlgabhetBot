Replies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:}}
* Those which identify ''who'' speaks Chinese
* Those which demonstrate how meaningless symbols can become meaningful
* Those which suggest that the Chinese room should be redesigned in some way
* Those which contend that Searle's argument is misleading
* Those which argue that the argument makes false assumptions about subjective conscious experience and therefore proves nothing

Some of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.
