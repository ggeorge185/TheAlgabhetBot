Carbonite freezing in ''Star Wars'' is first seen in the film ''The Empire Strikes Back'' when Darth Vader places Han Solo in a carbonite casing to be delivered to Jabba the Hutt.  The reverse process is seen in ''Return of the Jedi''. The technology also appears in ''The Mandalorian''.

Carbonite freezing is based on the concept of cryonics, which involves freezing a living organism to keep it in suspended animation. The technology is still being researched and developed by scientists into a more sophisticated form. Carbonite exists in real life as a type of gunpowder. According to professor James H. Fallon, the carbonite used in ''Star Wars'' might be a "dry ice" with an opposite charge. He further speculates that it is a form of carbon dioxide mineral, which, like in cryonics, is kept at very low temperatures, to the point that there is no need for oxygen or blood-flow. This could keep living organisms and living tissue in suspended animation. While the freezing process as depicted in the films is realistic, reversing the same process by heating, he argues, is more challenging, and can be dangerous if heated too fast. He also argues that this process, as depicted in the film, is a scientific, physical challenge.
