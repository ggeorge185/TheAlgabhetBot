Embodied cognitive perspectives can inform and impact motor skill research in the fields of sport and sport psychology. Studies have shown that the embodiment thesis comes into action through many ways in sport such as sport-related action-specific perception, understanding, prediction, judgement, training, and language comprehension. From an embodied cognition perspective, a study examined the relationship between previous Motor skill|motor and Visual perception|visual experience and the current officiating experience of expert judges and referees. These and similar studies show the influence of embodied cognition in sport and sport psychology.
