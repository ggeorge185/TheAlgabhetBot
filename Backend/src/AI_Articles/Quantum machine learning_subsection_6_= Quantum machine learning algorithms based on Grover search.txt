Another approach to improving classical machine learning with quantum information processing uses amplitude amplification methods based on Grover's algorithm|Grover's search algorithm, which has been shown to solve unstructured search problems with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. These quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an unstructured search task, as can be done, for instance, in the case of the K-medians clustering|k-medians and the k-nearest neighbour|k-nearest neighbors algorithms.

An example of amplitude amplification being used in a machine learning algorithm is Grover's search algorithm minimization. In which a subroutine uses Grover's search algorithm to find an element less than some previously defined element. This can be done with an oracle that determines whether or not a state with a corresponding element is less than the predefined one. Grover's algorithm can then find an element such that our condition is met. The minimization is initialized by some random element in our data set, and iteratively does this subroutine to find the minimum element in the data set. This minimization is notably used in quantum k-medians, and it has a speed up of at least <math>O(\sqrt)</math> compared to classical versions of k-medians, where <math>n</math> is the number of data points and <math>k</math> is the number of clusters. as well as the performance of reinforcement learning agents in the projective simulation framework.
