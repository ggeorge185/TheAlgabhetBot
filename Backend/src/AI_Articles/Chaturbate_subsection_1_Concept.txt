Chaturbate" is a portmanteau of "chat" and "masturbate". Viewers are allowed to watch for free (with the exception of private shows), but pay money in the form of "tips" in order to see certain sex acts performed.

Models can synchronize remote-controlled vibrators and other sex toys so that they can be activated when "tipped" and the frequencies affected by the amount of "tips" given, with the intention of "users paying to try to give [the models] an orgasm". There are popular chat rooms that can have more than 500,000 followers and can get up to 20,000 viewers at once. This is due in part to the "follow" button, which permits viewers to receive notifications when the model is broadcasting.

Another aspect of the site's inner workings is the use of "mods", short for "moderators", voluntary users who oversee that the broadcasts are compliant with Chaturbate policy, such as no violence or underage models.

Models need not be humans, as is the case with Projekt Melody, an artificial intelligence "Webcam model|cam girl", who has about 20,000 followers. However, Chaturbate did require the operator to prove their age.

The site itself earns revenues by taking roughly 40% from the model's earnings. Chaturbate generates revenue from the audience when they purchase tokens using their credit cards.  Each Chaturbate token is worth $0.05 to a model and they need to earn at least $50.00 to receive the payment. However, when purchased by viewers, tokens cost about $0.10, depending on the amount bought in a single transaction. which represented an increase from 167th globally and third in adult websites, trailing Xvideos and Livejasmin, in February 2017.
