The following is an example of a generic single-objective genetic algorithm.

Step One: Generate the initial population of individuals randomly. (First generation)

Step Two: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:

#Evaluate the Fitness function|fitness of each individual in the population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)
#Select the fittest individuals for reproduce|reproduction. (Parents)
# Breed new individuals through crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover and mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation operations to give birth to offspring.
# Replace the least-fit individuals of the population with new individuals.
