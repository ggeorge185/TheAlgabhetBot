Undergoing a course of Dental braces|orthodontic treatment in his early twenties, Chishti envisioned clear plastic appliances instead of metal braces. The Food and Drug Administration granted Align Technology approval to sell and market Invisalign in 1998.

In 2005, Chishti and several former Align Technology employees founded the medical device company Orthoclear. The company settled a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Align in 2006, with Align purchasing Orthoclear's intellectual property for $20 million. Chishti subsequently returned his attention to TRG.
