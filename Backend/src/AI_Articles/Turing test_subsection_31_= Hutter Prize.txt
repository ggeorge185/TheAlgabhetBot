The organisers of the Hutter Prize believe that compressing natural language text is a hard AI problem, equivalent to passing the Turing test.

The data compression test has some advantages over most versions and variations of a Turing test, including:

* It gives a single number that can be directly used to compare which of two machines is "more intelligent."
* It does not require the computer to lie to the judge

The main disadvantages of using data compression as a test are:

* It is not possible to test humans this way.
* It is unknown what particular "score" on this test—if any—is equivalent to passing a human-level Turing test.
