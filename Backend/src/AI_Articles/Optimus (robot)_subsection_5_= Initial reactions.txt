Soon after the first AI Day event, many publications reacted with skepticism about the proposed product. ''Bloomberg News'' claimed that such a product constituted "mission creep" and stood outside "the companyâ€™s clean-energy initiatives." ''The Washington Post'' argued that "Tesla has a history of exaggerating timelines and overpromising at its product unveilings and investor presentations." and, in an editorial, described the Tesla Bot reveal as a "bizarre and brilliant bit of wikt:tomfoolery|tomfoolery".

The progress made with the prototypes shown at the second AI Day was praised by some commentators. Other commentators stipulated that all that was shown in these latest presentations had already been accomplished by other robotics programs, and that there appears to be little to suggest Tesla could "outpace other companies working on similar things."
