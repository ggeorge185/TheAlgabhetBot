Some scholars have said that even if AGI poses an existential risk, attempting to ban research into artificial intelligence is still unwise, and probably futile. Skeptics argue that regulation of AI is completely valueless, as no existential risk exists. But scholars who believe in existential risk say it is difficult to depend on people from the AI industry to regulate or constrain AI research because it directly contradicts their personal interests. The scholars also agree with the skeptics that banning research would be unwise, as research could be moved to countries with looser regulations or conducted covertly. Two additional hypothetical difficulties with bans (or other regulation) are that technology entrepreneurs statistically tend toward general skepticism about government regulation, and that businesses could have a strong incentive to (and might well succeed at) fighting regulation and politicization of science|politicizing the underlying debate.
