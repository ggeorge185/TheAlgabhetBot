The use of AI technologies has been explored for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease. For diagnostic purposes, machine learning models have been developed that rely on structural MRI inputs. The input datasets for these models are drawn from databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Researchers have developed models that rely on Convolutional Neural Network|convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. Generative Adversarial Network|Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets. They suggest that generated patient forecasts could be used to provide future models larger training datasets than current open access databases.
