Two types of curiosity are ''state'' and ''trait'' curiosity. State curiosity is externalâ€”wondering why things happen just for the sake of curiousness, for example wondering why most stores open at 8&nbsp;a.m. Trait curiosity describes people who are interested in learning, for example by trying out a new sport or food, or traveling to an unfamiliar place. One can look at curiosity as the urge that draws people out of their comfort zones and fears as the agents that keep them within those zones.
