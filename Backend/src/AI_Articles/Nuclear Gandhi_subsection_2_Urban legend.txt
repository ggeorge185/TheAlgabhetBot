In  2012, 21 years after the original ''Civilization'' was released, the TV Tropes page for ''Civilization'' was edited by user Tunafish to add a claim that a software bug caused Gandhi to act much more aggressively, but did not include any proof for the claim.

On September 8, 2020, Sid Meier's autobiography, ''Sid Meier's Memoir!: A Life in Computer Games'', was released, containing confirmation that the Gandhi software bug was fabricated and a detailed background of the urban legend's formation.
