Animal cognition, or cognitive ethology, is a modern approach to the research and study of the  mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of comparative psychology, and has also been strongly influenced by the approach of ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology. Much of what was formerly known as "animal intelligence" is now thought of under this heading. Animal language acquisition, attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by linguistics-related study, has been controversial among cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists. There has been some examples of debate in regards to the methods and progress of animal cognition research, despite this there is still research being done in the field and progress is being made to better under stand the cognitive processes of animal life.
