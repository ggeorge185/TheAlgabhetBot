the application is a brain network test system that reenacts biophysical sensory cells characterized as numerical models and use the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model to portray the properties of brain cells
# the rundown of models will keep developing and will ultimately arrive at many models
# the test system gets information from XML records that contain cell properties which portray behavior
# the test system will process the framework's way of behaving over the long haul
# calculation results will be saved in records
