The Medical Devices Bureau of Health Canada recognizes four classes of medical devices based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices present the lowest potential risk and do not require a licence. Class II devices require the manufacturer's declaration of device safety and effectiveness, whereas Class III and IV devices present a greater potential risk and are subject to in-depth scrutiny.
* Class I (Canada) generally corresponds to Class I (ECD)
* Class II (Canada) generally corresponds to Class IIa (ECD)
* Class III (Canada) generally corresponds to Class IIb (ECD)
* Class IV (Canada) generally corresponds to Class III (ECD)
Examples include surgical instruments (Class I), contact lenses and ultrasound scanners (Class II), orthopedic implants and hemodialysis machines (Class III), and cardiac pacemakers (Class IV).
