Equitable design in technology has been hard to achieve because of the overwhelming presence of heterosexual white men in product design leadership. Designers in the tech industry stand in for the promise of innovation and entrepreneurialism, but also are part of one of the most unequal industries, with Black women only making up 1.7% of the tech workforce. In an industry where meaningful efforts to diversify are not made and structural inequality is rarely mentioned or challenges, design justice is an important call to rupture current design practices.
