SAIL's input/output system was based on the idea of numbered "channels" in a fashion somewhat similar to the scanner entries. To open a file, one first called  to return a value of a free channel, and then ed it with various parameters to describe the file and modes of operation.  was equivalent to close. Once opened, the file could be read, subject to the scanning rules noted above, by calling  and looking for the end-of-file. Files did not have names as part of the OPEN, instead,  could be used to point a channel at a given file,  made a new file associated with a channel, and  allowed an existing file name to be changed. One can open an existing file for writing using .

There were numerous special handlers and variables that were used during I/O. For instance, the  function was an INPUT hard-wired to the user terminal and always open, and it returns its break character in the system variable . The  function normally output to the same terminal channel, but could also be directed at any other opened channel.
