Notable software for Bayesian networks include:
* Just another Gibbs sampler (JAGS) – Open-source alternative to WinBUGS. Uses Gibbs sampling.
* OpenBUGS – Open-source development of WinBUGS.
* SPSS Modeler – Commercial software that includes an implementation for Bayesian networks.
* Stan (software) – Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
* PyMC3 – A Python library implementing an embedded domain specific language to represent bayesian networks, and a variety of samplers (including NUTS)
* WinBUGS – One of the first computational implementations of MCMC samplers. No longer maintained.
