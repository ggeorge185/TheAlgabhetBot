Image analysis#Land cover mapping|Land cover mapping is one of the major applications of Earth observation satellite sensors, using remote sensing and geospatial data, to identify the materials and objects which are located on the surface of target areas. Generally, the classes of target materials include roads, buildings, rivers, lakes, and vegetation. Some different ensemble learning approaches based on artificial neural networks, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), decision trees with Boosting (machine learning)|boosting, random forest and automatic design of multiple classifier systems, are proposed to efficiently identify land cover objects.
