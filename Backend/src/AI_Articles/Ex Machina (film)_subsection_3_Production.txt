The foundation for ''Ex Machina'' was laid when Garland was 11 or 12 years old, after he had done some basic coding and experimentation on a computer his parents had bought him and which he sometimes felt had a mind of its own. His later ideas came from years of discussions he had been having with a friend with an expertise in neuroscience, who claimed machines could never become sentient. Trying to find an answer on his own, he started reading books on the topic. During the pre-production of ''Dredd'', while going through a book by Murray Shanahan about consciousness and embodiment, Garland had an "epiphany". The idea was written down and put aside until later. Shanahan, along with Adam Rutherford, became a consultant for the film, and the International Standard Book Number|ISBN of his book is referred to as an Easter egg (media)|easter egg in the film. Besides the Turing test, the film references the Chinese room thought experiment, as well as Mary's room, a thought experiment about a scientist who has studied, but never experienced, the concept of colour. Other inspirations came from films like ''2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey'', ''Altered States'', and books written by Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ray Kurzweil, and others. It is also influenced by William Shakespeare's ''The Tempest''. Wanting total creative freedom, and without having to add conventional action sequences, Garland made the film on as small a budget as possible.
