In the ''Star Wars'' universe, two different types of fictional propulsion exist to allow starships to travel in space and across the galaxy: sublight drives and hyperdrives. Sublight drives propel starships below the speed of light and are used upon leaving a planet's atmosphere and during space battles. Many different varieties of sublight drives or sublight engines exist, but the most common are electromagnetic propulsion types like ion engines which release charged particles to propel the ship forward. Ion engines also lack moving parts and high-temperature components, making them easier to maintain.  Sublight drives can propel ''Star Wars'' vessels clear of a planet's atmosphere and gravity in a matter of minutes. Hyperspace is one of two dimensions of space-time. It is wikt:coterminous|coterminous with 'realspace' and permeated by "shadow" counterparts of realspace objects. Any object in hyperspace colliding with one of these shadows is destroyed, so in order to navigate safely, starships must utilize navigational computers (or navi-computers) to calculate a safe route through hyperspace. Thanks to hyperdrive technology, ''Star Wars'' ships can cover interstellar distances which would normally requires thousands of years in a matter of hours. The space probe ''Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn'' also uses ion propulsion, although unlike the TIE fighter it was fitted with three instead of just two.

In an examination of the amount of force generated by ''Star Wars'' sublight engines, Rhett Allain, associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, looked at the scene of a Hammerhead corvette ramming one Imperial Star Destroyer into another during the final space battle of ''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story''. He argues that the Hammerhead's engines would had to have exerted  (or 200 billion) Newton (unit)|Newtons in order to push the Star Destroyer. This would make them 6,000 times more powerful than a Saturn V rocket.
